    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      The night was close and stifling, and the dulled bellowing of the surf on
      the weather side of the island told me that the calm was about to break at
      last, and in another hour or so the thirsty, sandy soil would be drenched
      with the long-expected rain, and the drooping palms and pandanus trees
      wave their wearied branches to the cooling trade-wind once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rose from my rough bed of cane-work and mats, and, lighting my pipe,
      went outside, walked down to the beach, and seating myself on a canoe,
      looked out upon the wide expanse of ocean, heaving under a dark and
      lowering sky, and wondered moodily why I was ever such an idiot as to take
      charge of a trading station on such a God-forsaken place as Tarawa Island
      in the Gilbert Group.
    </p>
    <p>
      My house&mdash;or rather the collection of thatched huts which formed the
      trading station&mdash;stood quite apart from the native village, but not
      so far that I could not hear the murmur of voices talking in their deep,
      hoarse, guttural tongue, and see, moving to and fro on the beach, the
      figures of women and children sent out to see that the fleet of canoes
      lying on the beach was safe beyond the reach of the waves which the coming
      storm would send in sweeping, endless lines across the outer reef to the
      foot of the coco-palms fringing the low-lying, monotonous shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day had been a more than usually depressing one with me; and I had had
      many depressing days for the last four months. First of all, ever since I
      had landed on the island, nearly half a year before, I had suffered from
      bad health. Malarial fever, contracted in the gloomy, rain-soaked forests
      of New Ireland and New Britain, had poisoned my blood, soured my temper,
      and all but made me an old man at seven-and-twenty years of age. Violent
      attacks of ague, recurring with persistent and diabolical regularity every
      week for many months, had so weakened me, that although I was able to
      attend to my business and do justice to my employers, I felt that I should
      never live to see the end of my two years' engagement unless I either
      shook off the fever or was enabled to leave the torrid regions of the
      Equatorial Pacific for a cooler climate&mdash;such as Samoa or the
      Marquesas or Society Islands. The knowledge, moreover, of the fact that
      the fever was slowly but surely killing me, and that there was no prospect
      of my being relieved by my employers and sent elsewhere&mdash;for I had
      neither money, friends, nor influence&mdash;was an additional factor
      towards sending me into such a morbid condition of mind that I had often
      contemplated the idea&mdash;weak and ill as I was&mdash;of leaving the
      island alone in my whaleboat, and setting sail for Fiji or Samoa, more
      than a thousand miles distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most people may, perhaps, think that such an idea could only emanate in
      the brain of a lunatic; but such things had been done, time and time
      again, in my own knowledge in the Pacific, and as the fever racked my
      bones and tortured my brain, and the fear of death upon this lonely island
      assailed me in the long, long hours of night as I lay groaning and
      sweltering, or shaking with ague upon my couch of mats, the thought of the
      whale-boat so constantly recurred to me even in my more cheerful moments,
      when I was free from pain, that eventually I half formed a resolution to
      make the attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      For at the root of the despondency that ever overpowered me after a
      violent attack of ague there was a potent and never dormant agent urging
      me to action which kept me alive; and that was my personal vanity and
      desire to distinguish myself before I died, or when I died.
    </p>
    <p>
      For ten years I had sailed in the South Seas, and had had my full share of
      adventure and exciting episode, young as I was, as befell those who, in
      the &ldquo;sixties&rdquo; and &ldquo;seventies,&rdquo; ranged the Western and North-Western
      Pacific. But though I had been thrice through the murderous Solomon Group
      as &ldquo;recruiter&rdquo; for a Fijian labour vessel&mdash;&ldquo;blackbirders&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;slavers&rdquo; these craft are designated by good people who know nothing of
      the subject, and judge the Pacific Islands labour trade by two or three
      dreadful massacres perpetrated by Englishmen in the past&mdash;I had
      &ldquo;never done anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And to have &ldquo;done something&rdquo; in those days meant something worth talking
      about, something that would give a man a name and a place in the ranks of
      the daring men who had spent nearly all their lives in the South Seas.
      Little Barney Watt, the chief engineer of the <i>Ripple</i>, when the
      captain and most of the crew had been slaughtered by the niggers of
      Bougainville Island, had shut himself up in the deck-house, and, wounded
      badly as he was, shot seventeen of them dead with his Winchester, and
      cleared the steamer's decks. Then, with no other white man to help, he
      succeeded in bringing the <i>Ripple</i> to Sydney; Cameron, the
      shark-fisher, after his crew mutinied at Wake Island, escaped with his
      native wife in a dinghy, and made a voyage of fifteen hundred miles to the
      Marshall Group; Collier, of Tahiti, when the barque of which he was mate
      was seized by the native passengers off Peru Island and every white man of
      the crew but himself was murdered, blew up the vessel's main deck and
      killed seventy of the treacherous savages. Then, with but three native
      seamen and two little native girls to assist him, he sailed the barque
      back safely to Tahiti. And wherever men gathered together in the South
      Seas&mdash;in Levuka, in Apia, in Honolulu, in Papeite&mdash;you would
      hear them talk of &ldquo;Barney Watt,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cameron,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jack Collier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Should I, &ldquo;Jim Sherry,&rdquo; ever succeed in doing something similar? Would
      Fate be kind to me and give me a chance to distinguish myself, not only
      among my fellows, but to make my name known to that outside world from
      which in a fit of sullen resentment I had so long severed myself?
    </p>
    <p>
      As I sat on the mat-covered canoe, moody yet feverish, the first squall of
      rain came sweeping shoreward from the darkened sea-rim, and in a few
      minutes my burning skin was drenched and cooled from head to foot.
      Heedless of the storm, however, I remained without moving, watching the
      curling, phosphorescent breakers tumbling on the reef and listening with a
      feeling of pleasure to the rush and seethe of the rain squalls as they
      swept through the dense groves of coco-palms behind me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently I rose, and walking over to my boat-shed, which was but a few
      yards distant, I endeavoured to close the rough wooden doors so as to
      prevent the rain from blowing in and flooding the ground. But my strength
      was not equal to the task, for a puff of more than usual violence not only
      tore the handle of the door from my hand, but blew me inside the house.
      Feeling my way in the darkness along the boat's side, I reached her stern,
      where I was sheltered, and searched my saturated pockets to see if by any
      chance I had a box of matches, so that I could light my boat's lantern and
      have a look round the shed. I found a few loose ones, but so wetted as to
      be useless, and was just about to return to my dwelling-house in disgust,
      when I heard my name called softly, and a hand touched my knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; I said, greatly startled that any one should be in the
      boat-shed at such a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis I, Niâbon, the Danger Island girl; and Tematau lieth here on the
      ground near me. His master hath beaten him so that he is near to death.
      And we have come to seek aid from thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knew the speaker, but did not question her any further at the time,
      beyond asking her if he whom she called Tematau could rise and walk to the
      house. She replied in the affirmative, but the injured man was so weak
      that the girl and I had to support him between us and grope our way over
      to the house in face of the furious wind and driving rain. The moment we
      were inside we laid the injured man down, and I struck a match and lit a
      lamp, whilst Niâbon shut and locked the door, not against any possible
      intruders, but to keep out the rain and wind. Then, before doing anything
      else, I went into the store-room and got the woman a change of clothes&mdash;a
      rough, ready-made print gown such as the native women occasionally wear&mdash;and
      a warm rug for the man, who was wearing only the usual <i>airiri</i> or
      girdle of long grass, and then, changing my own sodden garments as quickly
      as possible, Niâbon and I gave our attention to her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor fellow had been fearfully beaten. The whole of his back, arms,
      and thighs were in a dreadful state, and the rain had caused the wounds to
      bleed afresh. But the worst injury was a deep cut on the face, extending
      from the lower left eyelid to the lobe of the ear, and exposing the bone.
      My surgery was none of the best, but I succeeded at last in sewing up the
      wound satisfactorily, the patient bearing the pain without flinching, and
      pressing my hand in gratitude when I told him I could do no more. As for
      his other injuries, the girl assured me that she herself would apply
      proper native remedies in the morning; and, knowing how very clever these
      natives are in such matters, I attempted nothing further beyond giving the
      man a glass or two of grog and a tin of sardines and some bread to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Niâbon,&rdquo; I said to the girl, whose face was stern and set, &ldquo;thou, too,
      must eat and then lie on my conch and sleep. I will sit here and read my
      book and watch the sick man, for the fever is in my bones to-night and I
      cannot sleep. So eat and rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. &ldquo;Nay, I feel no hunger, Simi,{*} and I would sit here
      with thee if it offend not. And then when the cold seizeth thee at the
      time when the dawn pushes away the night I can boil thee thy coffee.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Jim&mdash;pronounced Seemee.
</pre>
    <p>
      I was somewhat surprised that she knew that at dawn I usually had an
      attack of ague, for she lived ten miles away, and seldom even met any of
      the natives of the village where I was stationed, though she was well
      known to them by reputation. However, I was too ill and wearied at the
      time to think anything more of the matter, so after thanking her for her
      offer to sit up and attend the unfortunate Tematau I lay down on a cane
      lounge in the room and watched her making a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I fill thy pipe, Simi?&rdquo; she asked me as she approached me in a
      manner so self-reliant and unconcerned, and yet so dignified, that
      physically and mentally exhausted as I was I could not but feel
      astonished. For to me she was nothing more&mdash;as far as her appearance
      went&mdash;than an ordinary native woman, although I had quite often heard
      her name spoken in whispers as one who had dealings with the spirits and
      who had supernatural protection, and all that sort of stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you, Niabon,&rdquo; I replied, unintentionally speaking in English,
      &ldquo;I must not smoke again tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled and seated herself on a mat beside my couch, then rising
      suddenly she placed her hand on mine, and said as she looked into my eyes&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you speak Englis* to me, Simi? Who has been tell you I understan'
      Englis'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one, Niâbon. I did not know you could speak English or even understand
      it. Who taught you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall tell thee at some other time,&rdquo; she replied in the Tarawa dialect,
      and then pointing to the figure of her companion she said she was sure a
      smoke would do him good. I gave her a new clay pipe, which she filled,
      lit, and placed in Tematau's mouth. He drew at it with such a deep sigh of
      satisfaction that the woman's stern features relaxed into a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My blessing on thee, Simi,&rdquo; said the man, as he blew a stream of smoke
      through his nostrils; &ldquo;in but a few days I shall be strong, and then there
      shall be but one white man alive on Tarawa&mdash;thyself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Niâbon angrily bade him be silent and make no threats; it would be time
      enough, she said, to talk of revenge when he was able to put a gun to his
      shoulder or a hand to his knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How came this thing about?&rdquo; I asked her presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The German sent Tematau away in his boat to one of the little islands at
      the far end of the lagoon to gather coco-nuts, and bade him hasten back
      quickly. Tematau and those with him filled the boat with husked coco-nuts,
      and were sailing homewards in the night when she struck on a reef and tore
      a great hole in her side. Then the surf broke her in pieces, and Tematau
      and the other men had to swim long hours to reach the shore. And as thou
      knowest, the north end of the lagoon hath many sharks, and it is bad to
      swim there at night even for a little time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad indeed, Niâbon,&rdquo; I said, with a shudder; &ldquo;'tis a wonder that any one
      of them reached the shore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled mysteriously. &ldquo;They were safe, for each one had around his neck
      a cord of black cinnet interwoven with the hair of a sea-ghost. So they
      came to no harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke with such calm assurance that I carefully abstained from even a
      smile. Then she went on&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When they reached the white man's house and told him that the boat was
      lost he became mad with rage, and seizing a hatchet he hurled it at
      Tematau and cut his face open. Then as he fell to the ground the German
      seized a whip of twisted shark-skin and beat him until he could beat no
      longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she went on to tell me that the unfortunate man was carried to the
      house where she lived, and she, knowing that I should be well able and
      willing to protect him, decided to bring him to me. The only difficulty
      that presented itself to her was that the people of the village in which I
      lived, though not exactly at enmity with the natives of the north end of
      the island, were distinctly averse to holding any more communication with
      them than was absolutely necessary, and a refugee such as Tematau would
      either be turned back or kept as a slave. For, for nearly fifty-five years
      internecine feuds had been kept alive among the various clans on the
      island, and had caused terrible slaughter on many occasions. Whole
      villages had been given to the flames, and every soul, even children in
      arms, massacred by the conquering party. The advent of white men as
      traders had, however, been of great advantage to the island generally in
      one respect&mdash;the savage, intractable inhabitants began to recognise
      the fact that so long as they warred among themselves the white man would
      be averse to remaining among them, and consequently for the four years
      previous to my arrival on Tarawa there had been no tribal battle, though
      isolated murders were by no means uncommon. But owing to the white men's
      influence an amicable arrangement was always arrived at by the contending
      parties, i.e., the relatives of the murdered man and the aggressors.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was for this reason that Niâbon had brought the injured man to my
      village by a very circuitous route, so as to avoid meeting any of the
      people. Once he and she were inside my house to claim my protection there
      would be no further difficulty. She had succeeded in getting her companion
      into my boat-shed unobserved, and when the storm burst was patiently
      awaiting darkness so that she might bring the man to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was her story, and now I will relate something of the woman herself
      and of the white man of whom she had spoken, the German trader Krause.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      When I first landed on Tarawa, this man, whose name was Krause, according
      to the usual custom among us traders, called to see me. He was a big,
      broad-shouldered, good-looking fellow, and certainly was very civil and
      obliging to me in many ways, although I was an &ldquo;opposition&rdquo; trader; and a
      new man is never welcome from a business point of view, no matter how much
      he may be liked for social reasons, especially in the God-forsaken
      Equatorial Pacific, where whilst your fellow-trader is ready to share his
      last bottle of grog and his last tin of beef with you, he is anxious to
      cut your throat from a business point of view. Krause, however, did not
      seem to&mdash;and I honestly believe did not actually&mdash;entertain any
      ill-feeling towards me as a rival trader, although I was landed on the
      island with such a stock of new trade goods that he must at once have
      recognised the fact that my advent would do him serious injury, inasmuch
      as his employers (the big German trading firm in Hamburg) had not sent him
      any fresh stock for six months. Like most Germans of any education whom
      one meets in the South Seas, or anywhere else, he was a good native
      linguist, though, like all his countrymen, he did not <i>understand</i>
      natives like Englishmen or Americans understand wild races. He had no
      regard nor sympathy for them, and looked upon even the highly intelligent
      Polynesian peoples with whom he had had much dealing as mere &ldquo;niggers&rdquo;&mdash;to
      study whose feelings, sentiments, opinions or religious belief, was
      beneath the consideration of an European. But although he thus despised
      the natives generally from one end of the Pacific to the other, he had
      enough sense to keep his opinions reasonably well to himself, only
      expressing his contempt for them to his fellow traders, or to any other
      white men with whom he came in contact.

       alt="Sailing Across the Lagoon to his Station 028 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      A few weeks after my arrival on the island I paid him a visit, sailing
      across the lagoon to his station in my whaleboat. On reaching his place I
      found that he was away from home on a trip to one of his minor outlying
      stations, and would not return till the evening. Somewhat disappointed at
      missing him, I got out of my boat with the intention of at least resting
      in one of the native huts for half an hour, so as to be out of the intense
      heat and glare of a torrid sun, when one of Krause's servants came down
      and said that the trader's wife would be glad if I would come to her
      husband's station and there await his return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glad to accept the invitation, for I was weak and tired out from fever,
      and ready to lie down almost anywhere out of the sun, I walked wearily
      along the beach and entered the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      To my intense surprise, there came to meet me at the door, not the usual
      style of native wife one generally sees in most traders' houses&mdash;a
      good-looking young woman with a flaming blouse, and more flaming skirt of
      hideously coloured print, and fingers covered with heavy gold rings&mdash;but
      a slenderly-built pale-complexioned woman of apparently thirty years of
      age, dressed in a light yellow muslin gown, such as the Portuguese ladies
      of Macao and the Mariana Islands wear. The moment I saw her I knew that
      she had but a very slight strain of native blood in her veins, and when
      she spoke her voice sounded very sweet and refined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not come inside and rest, sir?&rdquo; she said in English. &ldquo;My husband
      is away, and will not be back until about sunset; he will be very
      disappointed to have missed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Mrs. Krause,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;I think I must accept your
      invitation, as I feel a bit shaky, and it has been so very hot crossing
      the lagoon.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very, very hot, indeed, Mr. Sherry,&rdquo; she said, as she
      motioned me to enter the front room; &ldquo;and I know what malarial fever is;
      for I once lived at Agana, in Guam, and have seen many people who have
      come there from the Philippine Islands to recruit. Now, lie down there on
      that cane lounge, beside the open window, and let me bring you something
      to drink&mdash;something cool. What would you like? There is làger beer,
      there is very cold water from a canvas water-bag, and there is some hock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gratefully took a long drink of the cold water, and then, instead of
      lying down, seated myself in a wide cane chair, and began to talk to my
      hostess, who sat on the lounge a few feet away, and now that I had an
      opportunity of closer observation, I saw that she was&mdash;despite her
      pallor and worn appearance&mdash;a woman of the very greatest beauty and
      grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so long since I had even talked to a white woman, even of the
      commonest class, that I could not but be insensibly attracted to her, and
      when in a few minutes she smiled at something I said about my longing to
      get away to Samoa, even if I had to sail there alone in my whaleboat, the
      faint flush that tinged her cheek seemed to so transfigure her that she
      looked like a girl of nineteen or twenty. She talked to me for nearly an
      hour, and I noticed that although we conversed principally about the Line
      Islands, and the natives, and of our few white neighbours scattered
      throughout the group, and their idiosyncrasies&mdash;humorous and
      otherwise&mdash;she hardly ever mentioned her husband's name, except when
      I asked her some direct question concerning him, such as the number of his
      outlying stations, was he fond of fishing or shooting, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some way I came to the conclusion that she was an unhappy woman as far
      as her relations with her husband went; and without the slightest reason
      whatever to guide me to such an inference, felt that he, and not she, was
      to blame; and even as we talked, there was unconsciously taking possession
      of me a dislike to a man from whom I had experienced nothing but civility
      and kindness. Just as she was leaving the room to attend to her household
      duties, the man Tematau came to the door, carrying a string of
      freshly-husked young drinking coco-nuts. At a sign from his mistress, he
      opened one and brought it to me, and then leaving a few beside my chair,
      took the remainder down to my boat's crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0003" id="linkimage-0003">

    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">
      <img src="images/032.jpg" alt="The Man Tematau Came to the Door 032 "   width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is Tematau, my husband's head boatman,&rdquo; said my hostess in her soft
      tones, as she watched him walking down to the beach; &ldquo;he is so different
      from these noisy, quarrelsome Tarawa people, that I am always glad to have
      him about the house when he is not wanted in the boats. He is so quick,
      and yet so quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought he did not look like a Tarawa native,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and I saw that
      he is tattooed like a Samoan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has lived in Samoa for a great many years, and is very proud of that
      tattooing, I am sure. He is a native of Danger Island, a long way to the
      south-east of this group, and came here about a year ago with a girl named
      Niàbon.&rdquo; She hesitated a little. &ldquo;I suppose you have not heard of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have not. Who is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&mdash;that is, the natives generally, and some of the whites as well&mdash;call
      her 'the Danger Island witch woman.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;I <i>have</i> heard of the 'witch woman,' but
      that was when I was trading at Gallic Harbour on Admiralty Island. There
      was a poor fellow there, Hairy Willard, who was dying of poison given him
      by some chief, and I remember quite well his wife, who was a Tahitian,
      telling me that if the witch woman of Danger Island was near she would
      quickly render the poison innocuous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Krause's dark eyes lit up with undoubted pleasure&mdash;&ldquo;I must tell
      her that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she living on Tarawa, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in this village, and she is in the house at this moment. She would
      like to speak to you. Do you mind her coming in?&rdquo; &ldquo;Indeed, I shall be very
      pleased.&rdquo; My hostess stood at the table for a few moments, with her face
      averted from me. Then she turned and spoke to me, and to my astonishment I
      saw that she was struggling hard to suppress her tears. I rose and led her
      to a seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not well, Mrs. Krause,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Sit down, and let me call one of
      your servants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, please do not do that, Mr. Sherry. But I will sit down, and&mdash;and
      I should like to ask you a question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was trembling as she spoke, but suddenly whipped out her handkerchief,
      dried her tears, and sat up erect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Sherry, you are an Englishman, or an American&mdash;I do not know
      which&mdash;but I am sure that you are a gentleman and will truthfully
      answer the question I ask. Will you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, indeed, if it is in my power to do so,&rdquo; I replied earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She placed her hand on mine and looked at me steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Sherry, you and I have been talking on various matters for more than
      an hour. Have I, in your opinion, given you the impression that I am
      mentally deranged? Look at me. Tell me&mdash;for I am an unhappy,
      heartbroken woman, whose life for two years has been a daily torture and
      misery&mdash;what you <i>do</i> think. Sometimes I imagine that what my
      husband says <i>may</i> be true&mdash;and then I collapse and wish I were
      dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he say, Mrs. Krause?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says that I am mad, and he says it so persistently that&mdash;oh, Mr.
      Sherry, I feel that before long I <i>shall</i> go mad in reality. It is
      only this woman Niàbon who sustains me. But for her I should have run out
      along the reef and drowned myself a year ago. Now, tell me, Mr. Sherry, do
      you think it possible that owing to the continuous strain upon me mentally
      and physically&mdash;for I am really very weak, and had a long illness two
      years ago when my baby was born&mdash;that my mind has become unhinged in
      any way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, Mrs. Krause,&rdquo; I said slowly and very emphatically, &ldquo;that your
      husband himself must be mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wept silently, and then, again averting her face, looked away from me
      towards the wide expanse of the lagoon, gleaming hot and silvery under a
      blazing sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish that what you say were true, Mr. Sherry,&rdquo; she said presently,
      trying bravely to suppress her tears, &ldquo;and that my husband were indeed
      mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose, extended her hand to me, and tried to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will think that I am a very silly woman, Mr. Sherry. But I am not at
      all strong, and you must forgive me. Now I must leave you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But am I not to see the famous witch woman, Mrs. Krause?&rdquo; I said half
      jestingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. She shall come to you presently. And you will like her, Mr.
      Sherry, I am sure. To me she been been the kindest, kindest friend.&rdquo; Then
      she paused awhile, but resumed in a nervous, hesitating manner, &ldquo;Niaban is
      sometimes a little strange in her manner, so&mdash;so you most not mind
      all that she may say or do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I assured her that I should be most careful to avoid giving any offence to
      the woman. She thanked me earnestly, and then said she would find Niàbon
      and bring or send her to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as she went out I heard some one tapping at the latticed window near
      which I was sitting. Looking out, I saw the face of the man Tematau, who
      was standing outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I come in and speak with thee, gentleman?&rdquo; he said in Samoan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enter, and welcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stepped round to the front door, and as he entered I saw that he had
      stripped to the waist; his hair was dressed in the Samoan fashion, and in
      his hand he carried a small, finely-plaited mat. In an instant I
      recognised that he was paying me a visit of ceremony, according to Samoan
      custom, so instead of rising and shaking hands with him, I kept my seat
      and waited for him to approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stepping slowly across the matted floor, with head and shoulders bent, he
      placed the mat (his offering) at my feet, and then withdrew to the other
      side of the room, and, seating himself cross-legged, he inquired after my
      health, etc., and paid me the usual compliments.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke in Samoan, I, of course, replied in the same language, thanked
      him for his call, and requested him to honour me at my own place by a
      visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, to my surprise, instead of retiring with the usual Samoan
      compliments, he bent forward, and, fixing his deep-set, gloomy eyes on
      mine, he said slowly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master, I shall be a true man to thee when we are together upon the deep
      sea in thy boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why dost thou call me 'master'?&rdquo; I said quickly, &ldquo;and when and whither do
      thee and I travel together?&rdquo; &ldquo;I call thee 'master' because I am thy
      servant, but when and whither we go upon the far sea I know not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he rose, saluted me as if I were King Malietoa of Samoa himself, and
      retired without uttering another word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a curious sort of a household,&rdquo; I thought. &ldquo;The mistress, who is
      sane enough, is told by her husband that she is mad, and fears she will
      lose her reason; a native who tells me that I am to be his master and
      travel with him on the deep sea, and a witch woman, whom I have yet to
      see, on the premises. I wonder what sort of a crank <i>she</i> is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was soon to know, for in a few moments she came in, and instead of
      coming up to me and shaking hands in the usual Line Island fashion, as I
      expected she would do, she did precisely as my first visitor had done&mdash;greeted
      me in Samoan, formally and politely, as if I were a great chief, and then
      sat silent, awaiting me to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Addressing her in the same stilted, highly complimentary language that she
      had used to me, I inquired after her health, etc., and then asked her how
      long she had been on the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered me in a somewhat abrupt manner, &ldquo;I came here with Tematau
      about the time that the white lady Lucia and her husband came. Tematau is
      of the same family as myself. And it is of the blood ties between us that
      we remain together, for we are the last of many.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is good that it is so,&rdquo; I said, for want of something better to say,
      for her curious eyes never left my face for an instant. &ldquo;It would be hard
      indeed that when but two of the same blood are left they should separate
      or be separated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be together always,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;and death will come to us
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she rose, walked quickly to the open door, glanced outside to see if
      any one was about, and returned to me and placed her hand on mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This man Krause is a devil. He seeks his wife's death because of another
      woman in his own country. He hath tried to poison her, and the poison
      still rankles in her blood. That is why she is so white of face and frail
      of body. And now she will neither eat nor drink aught but that of which I
      first eat or drink myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How know you of this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it well,&rdquo; she answered impressively, &ldquo;and the man would kill me if
      he could by poison, as he hath tried to kill his wife. But poison can do
      me no harm. And he hateth but yet is afraid of me, for he knoweth that I
      long since saw the murder in his heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are strange things to say, Niâbon. Beware of an unjust accusation
      when it comes to the too ready tongue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed scornfully. &ldquo;No lie hath ever fouled mine. I tell thee again,
      this man is a devil, and has waited for a year past to see his wife die,
      for he married her according to the laws of England, and cannot put her
      away as he could do had he married her according to the native custom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who hath told thee of these marriage laws of England?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it matter who hath told me?&rdquo; she asked sharply. &ldquo;Is not what I
      say true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, it is true. And it is true also that she and thee and the man Tematau
      and I shall together look death in the face upon the wide sea. And is not
      thy boat ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her strange, mysterious eyes as she spoke seemed to me&mdash;a physically
      weak but still mentally strong man at the moment&mdash;to have in them
      something weird, something that one could not affect either to ignore or
      despise. What could this woman know of my desire to leave the island in my
      boat? What could the man Tematau know of it? Never had I spoken of such an
      intention to any person, and I knew that, even in my worst attacks of
      fever and ague, I had never been delirious in the slightest degree. A
      sudden resentment for the moment took possession of me, and I spoke
      angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is all this silly talk? What have I to do with thee, and for what
      should my boat be ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be not angry with them, Simi, for there is nought but goodwill toward
      thee in my heart. See, wouldst have me cure the hot fever that makes the
      blood in thy veins to boil even now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said sullenly, &ldquo;I want none of thy foolish charms or medicines.
      Dost think I am a fool?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; and she looked at me so wistfully that I at once repented of my
      harsh manner&mdash;&ldquo;nay, indeed, Simi. Thou art a man strong in thy mind,
      and shall be strong in thy body if thou wouldst but let me give thee&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more, woman,&rdquo; I said roughly. &ldquo;Leave me. I want none of thy medicines,
      I say again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy wish is my law,&rdquo; she said gently, &ldquo;but, ere I leave thee, I pray thee
      that in a little way thou wilt let me show thee that I <i>do</i> mean well
      to thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laughed, and asked her what medicine or charm she desired to experiment
      with upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No medicine, and no charm,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;But I know that because of
      many things thy mind and thy body alike suffer pain, and that sleep would
      be good for thee. And I can give thee sleep&mdash;strong, dreamless sleep
      that, when thou awakenest, will make thee feel strong in thy body and
      softer in thy now angry heart to Niâbon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can make me sleep now, I'll give you twenty dollars,&rdquo; I said in my
      English fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took no notice of my rude and clumsy remark, though she had good
      reason to be offended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simi,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;shall I give thee sleep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;give me sleep till the master of this house returns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose and bent over me, and then I noticed for the first time that,
      instead of being about thirty-five or forty years of age, as I had judged
      her to be by her hard, clear features and somewhat &ldquo;bony&rdquo; appearance
      externally, she could not be more than five-and-twenty, or even younger.
    </p>
    <p>
      She placed her right hand on my forehead, and held my right hand in her
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sleep,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;sleep well and dreamlessly, man with the strong
      will to accomplish all that is before thee. Sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hand passed caressingly oyer my face, and in a few minutes I <i>was</i>
      asleep, and slept as I had not slept for many weeks past. When I awakened
      at sunset I felt more refreshed and vigorous than I had been for many
      months.

    <p>
      Krause had just returned in his boat, and met me with outstretched hand.
      His welcome was, I thought, unnecessarily effusive, and, declining his
      pressing invitation to remain for the night, I left, after remaining an
      hour or so longer. I noticed that immediately Krause arrived the girl
      Niâbon disappeared, and did not return.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was my first meeting with her, and I did not see her again till the
      evening of the storm, when she brought Tematau to me.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      We, Niâbon, Tematau and myself, were undisturbed by any visitors during
      the night, for the storm increased in violence, and, as daylight
      approached, the clamour of the surf upon the reef was something terrific.
      About four in the morning, however, there came such a thunderous, sudden
      boom that the island seemed shaken to its coral foundations, and Niâbon
      declared that the storm had broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what the people of the Tokelau Islands call <i>O le fati le galu</i>&mdash;the
      last great wave, that gathering itself together far out on the ocean,
      rushes to the reef, and curling high up as the mast of a ship, falls and
      shakes the land from one side to the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl knew what she was talking about, for from that moment the fury of
      the wind sensibly decreased, and half an hour later we were able to open
      the door and gaze out upon the sea, still seething white with broken,
      tumbling surf?
    </p>
    <p>
      Walking down to my boat-house, I found that the boat herself was not
      injured in any way, though most of the roof had been blown away. Then
      feeling that my usual attack of ague was coming on, I returned to the
      house, and found that Niâbon had made my coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      I drank it, and then wrapped myself up in a couple of blankets in
      readiness for the first touch of that deadly, terrible chill which seems
      to freeze the marrow in the bones of any one who is suffering from
      malarial fever. Niâbon watched me gravely, and then came and stood beside
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Sherry,&rdquo; she said, this time speaking in English, &ldquo;why don't you let
      me give you some medicine to cure you of that fever? I <i>can</i> cure
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you can, Niâbon,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;you certainly mesmerised me when
      I was at Krause's station that day, and I awakened feeling a lot better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is 'mesmerise'?&rdquo; she asked quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sending any one to sleep, as you did me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can always do that,&rdquo; she said simply, &ldquo;and so could my mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you make me sleep now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not just now. Wait till the col' fit has gone. And then when you are wake
      up I shall have some medicine ready for you, and then you shall have no
      more fever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My attack of ague lasted about half an hour, and left me with the usual
      splitting headache and aching bones. When I was able to turn myself, I saw
      that Niâbon was seated beside Tematau dressing his lacerated back with
      some preparation of crushed leaves. She heard me move, turned her head,
      and smiled, and said she would be with me in a few moments. Although my
      head was bursting with pain, I watched her with interest, noting the
      tenderness with which her smooth, brown fingers touched her companion's
      body. When she had finished she rose, carefully washed and dried her
      shapely hands, and came over to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me thy hand,&rdquo; she said in the native dialect, as she knelt beside my
      couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave her my left hand. She clasped it firmly but softly, and then the
      fingers of her right hand gently pressed down my eyelids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sleep, sleep long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I felt the gentle pressure of her hand down my face, my throbbing
      temples cooled, and in a minute, or even less, I sank into a dreamless and
      profound slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I awakened it was past nine o'clock, and I found that my own two
      native servants, who slept in the village, had prepared my breakfast, and
      were seated beside Tematau, talking to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Niâbon?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      They told me that she had gone away in search of some plant, or plants,
      with which to compound the medicine she was making for me. She returned
      early in the forenoon, carrying a small basket in which I saw a coil of
      the long creeping vine called '<i>At 'At</i> by the natives, and which
      grows only on the sandiest and most barren soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been sleep well, Mr. Sherry?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I did sleep well,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;and, more than that, I have eaten a
      better breakfast than I have for many weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded and showed me the contents of her basket, and then seating
      herself at the table, ate a small piece of ship biscuit and drank a cup of
      coffee. It was then that I noticed for the first time that she was, if not
      beautiful, a very handsome woman. Her face and hands were a reddish brown,
      darkened the more by the sun, for I could see under the thin muslin gown
      that she was wearing, that her arms and shoulders were of a much lighter
      hue, and I felt sure that she had some white blood in her veins. Her hair
      was, though somewhat coarse, yet long, wavy, and luxuriant, and was coiled
      loosely about her shapely head, one thick fold drooping over her left
      temple, and shading half of the smooth forehead with its jet-black and
      gracefully arched eyebrows. This is as much as I can say about her looks,
      and as regards her dress, that is easy enough to describe. She invariably
      wore a loose muslin or print gown, waistless, and fastened at the neck;
      underneath this was the ordinary Samoan <i>lava lava</i> or waist-cloth of
      navy blue calico. Her gown, however, was better made, and of far better
      material than those worn by the native women generally; in fact she and
      Mrs. Krause dressed much alike, with the exception that the latter, of
      course, wore shoes, and Niâbon's stockingless feet were protected only by
      rude sandals of coco-nut fibre such as are still worn by the natives of
      the Tokelaus and other isolated and low-lying islands of the Equatorial
      Pacific.
    </p>
    <p>
      After making and smoking a cigarette she set about compounding my fever
      mixture by first crushing up the coil of '<i>At 'At</i> and then
      expressing the thick colourless jelly it contained into the half of a
      coco-nut shell, which she placed on some glowing embers, and fanned gently
      till it began to give off steam. Then taking half a dozen ripe Chili
      berries, she pounded them into a pulp between two stones, added them to
      the '<i>At 'At</i>, and stirred the mixture till it boiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all, Simi,&rdquo; she said, as she removed the shell from the fire, and
      set it aside; &ldquo;when it is cool enough to drink, you must take one-fourth
      part; another when the sun is <i>tu'u tonu iluga</i> (right overhead), and
      the rest to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thanked her, and promised to carry out her instructions, and then said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you talk to me in three different languages, Niâbon? I like to
      hear you speak English best, you speak it so prettily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not the ghost of a smile crossed her face, and she replied in Samoan that
      she did not care to speak English to any one who understood Samoan, or
      indeed any other native language. &ldquo;I am a native woman,&rdquo; she added
      somewhat abruptly, &ldquo;and English cometh hard to my tongue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said nothing further on the subject, fearing I might vex her, although I
      felt pretty sure that she was <i>not</i> a full-blooded native. However, I
      had no right to worry her with questions, and if she preferred to be
      thought a native it was no business of mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as my medicine had cooled a little, I took my first dose. It
      tasted like Hades boiled down, and made me gasp for breath. Then Niàbon
      bade me wrap myself up in all the rugs and blankets I could procure, and
      undergo a good perspiration, assuring me that I should have no more
      attacks of the dreaded ague after the second dose. Calling one of my
      native servants, a big hulking native named Tepi, to come and roll me up
      presently, I first went over to Tematau, and asked him how he was doing,
      and as I stooped down to examine his head, and see if the dressing was all
      right, a heavy booted footstep sounded outside, and Krause walked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      One look at his face showed me that he was labouring with suppressed
      passion, though trying hard to conceal it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; I said without advancing to him; &ldquo;take that chair over
      there, please. I just want to look at this fellow's head for a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stalked over to the chair I indicated and sat down, and a sudden spasm
      of rage distorted his face when he saw Niâbon. She was seated at the
      further end of the room, her chin resting on her hand, and looking at him
      so steadily and fixedly that he could not but have resented her gaze, even
      if his mind were undisturbed by passion. Tematau, too, turned his head,
      and shot his master a glance of such deadly fury that I murmured to him to
      keep quiet. I rapidly revolved in my mind what course to pursue with our
      visitor, who, though I could not see his face, was, I felt, watching my
      every movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; I said to my patient in the island dialect, which Krause
      understood and spoke thoroughly; &ldquo;lie down again. In a few days thou wilt
      be able to walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God, he's going to walk <i>now</i>,&rdquo; said Krause, rising suddenly, and
      speaking in a low, trembling tone. I motioned to him to sit down again. He
      shook his head and remained standing, his brawny hand grasping the back of
      the chair to steady himself, for every nerve in his body was quivering
      with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter, Mr. Krause?&rdquo; I said coldly, though I was hot enough
      against him, for he was armed with a brace of navy revolvers, belted
      around his waist. &ldquo;Won't you sit down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I won't sit down,&rdquo; he answered rudely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then, stand,&rdquo; I said, seating myself near him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I pointed to the pistols in his belt. &ldquo;Mr. Krause, before you tell me
      the business which has brought you here, I should like to know why you
      enter my house carrying arms? It is a most extraordinary thing that one
      white man should call on another armed with a brace of pistols, especially
      when the island is quiet, and white men's lives are as safe here as they
      would be in London or Berlin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I brought my pistols with me because I thought I might have trouble with
      the natives over that fellow there,&rdquo; he said sullenly, pointing to
      Tematau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you might have left them outside; I object most strongly to any one
      marching into my house in the manner you have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He unbuckled his belt, and with a contemptuous gesture threw the whole lot
      outside the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Krause,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I feel more at ease now, so will you
      kindly tell me the object of your visit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've come to get that swine Tematau. I pay him. He is my man. I shall
      tolerate no interference. I shall take him back to Taritai&rdquo; (the name of
      the village where he lived) &ldquo;if I have to fight my way out of this village
      of yours and kill fifty of your niggers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady yourself, Mr. Krause, and don't say 'your niggers' so
      emphatically. In the first place I have but two native servants, not
      fifty, but either of those two would very much resent your calling him a
      'nigger.' You know as well as I do that to call a native of this island,
      or of any other island of the group, a nigger, is so grossly insulting
      that his knife would be out in an instant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you and I have different ideas on the subject,&rdquo; he said sneeringly;
      &ldquo;but that does not matter to me at the moment. My paid servant has
      absconded from my service, and I have come to get him. That is plain
      enough, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite. But I am an Englishman, Mr. Krause, and not to be easily bluffed
      because a man comes stamping into my house with a brace of pistols in his
      belt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not come here to argue. I came here for that nigger&mdash;my
      property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your <i>property!</i> Is the man a slave? Now, look here, Mr. Krause; you
      have used the man so brutally that he is unable to stand on his feet. He
      and the girl&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want the girl, and I daresay you do,&rdquo; he said, with a sneering
      laugh that made me long to haul off and hit the fellow between the eyes;
      &ldquo;she's a nuisance, and if I ever again see her prowling about my house and
      practising her infernal fooleries on my wife, I'll put a bullet through
      her. But the man I <i>will</i> have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; I cried warningly, as he took a step toward the sick man, &ldquo;stop,
      before you run yourself into mischief. Listen to me. I have but to raise
      my hand and call, and you will find yourself trussed up fore and aft to a
      pole like a pig, and carried back to your village.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of my way,&rdquo; he shouted hoarsely, as with blazing eyes he tried to
      thrust me aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back, man, back!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Are you mad? The natives here will kill you
      if you attempt to force&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I'll kill you, you meddlesome English hog,&rdquo; he said through his set
      teeth, and, before I could guard, his right hand shot out and grasped me
      by the throat, and he literally swung me off my feet and dashed me against
      the centre posts of the house with such violence that I went down in a
      heap.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I came to a few minutes afterwards, Tepi was supporting me on his
      knees, and Niâbon was putting some brandy to my lips. The house was full
      of natives, who were speaking in suppressed but excited tones. I swallowed
      the brandy, and then, as Tepi helped me to rise, the natives silently
      parted to right and left, and I saw something that, half-dazed as I was,
      filled me with horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Krause lay on his back in the centre of the room, his white duck clothes
      saturated with blood, which was still welling from three or four wounds in
      his deep, broad chest. I went over to him. He was dead.

    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who hath done this?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, master,&rdquo; and Tematau placed an ensanguined hand on mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said a softer voice, and Niâbon's eyes met mine calmly. &ldquo;Tematau
      and I together each stabbed him twice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as I was able to pull myself together, I desired all the natives
      but three of the head men to leave, and then, after the unfortunate
      German's body was covered from view by a large mat, I asked the principal
      man of the village to tell me what he knew of the tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing,&rdquo; was his reply. &ldquo;Niâbon can tell thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Niâbon, in response to my inquiring glance&mdash;I was shaking from head
      to foot as I looked at her, but her calm, quiet eyes as she looked into
      mine restored my nerve&mdash;spoke clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The German dashed thee against the centre posts of the house, Simi. Then
      he drew a little pistol from his breast and shot at me, and the bullet
      struck me on the neck. See,&rdquo; and she showed us a still bleeding score on
      the right side of her neck, where a Derringer bullet had cut through the
      flesh. &ldquo;And then he sprang at Tematau, but Tematau was on his feet and met
      him and stabbed him twice; and, as he fell I too stabbed him in the
      breast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is an evil day for me,&rdquo; I said to the three head men, &ldquo;and I fear it
      will prove an evil day to the people of this village, for the wife of the
      man who lies there told me that a ship of war of his country was soon to
      be here at this island. And how shall we account for his death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Niâbon bent forward and spoke&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have no fear, Simi. Neither thou, nor Tematau, nor the people of this
      village, nor I, shall come to any harm from the German fighting-ship. For
      when it comes thou and I, and Tematau, and Tepi, who know of the blood let
      out this day upon the floor of thy house, will be far away. And when the
      captain of the fighting-ship questioneth, and sayeth to the people, 'Where
      is my countryman?' the people will shake their heads and say, 'We know
      not. He and his wife, and the Englishman, and Tepi, and Tematau, and the
      witch woman Niâbon have gone. They have sailed away to beyond the rim of
      the sea and the sky&mdash;we know not whither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I listened with all my faculties wide awake, and yet with a strange sense
      of helplessness overpowering me. Then Niâbon made a swift gesture to the
      head men. They rose, and lifting the huge body of Krause, carried it away.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came to me and pressed her hand on my forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are tired,&rdquo; she said in English. &ldquo;Lie down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took my hand and led me to my couch beside the window and then bent
      over me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sleep, sleep long. For now the time is near and thou must have strength.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      I slept well on towards four o'clock in the afternoon, and when I awakened
      I found the house deserted by all but my man Tepi, who was seated
      cross-legged near me with a cup containing my fever mixture beside him. He
      held it up to me silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even before I raised myself to drink I felt that I was a stronger man,
      physically and mentally, than I had been six hours previously, and my
      veins no longer seemed as if they were filled with liquid fire. I drank
      the mixture and then looked about me, and saw that every ensanguined trace
      of the tragedy which had occurred a few hours before had been removed. The
      coarse and somewhat worn matting which had covered the floor had been
      taken away and replaced by new squares, and the room presented the usual
      neat and orderly appearance in which it was always kept by Tepi and my
      other servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master,&rdquo; said Tepi, &ldquo;art hungry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I would eat; but first tell me of the dead man. Who
      hath taken him away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man, instead of answering me in a straightforward manner, bent his
      head and muttered something I could not hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      I jumped off my couch and went outside, and the first person I ran against
      was my cook, an old grizzled fellow of about sixty years of age named Pai.
      He was carrying a freshly-killed fowl in his hand, looked at me in an
      unconcerned manner as if nothing had occurred, and asked me would I have
      it broiled or boiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you will,&rdquo; I said impatiently. &ldquo;Tell me, Pai, whither have they taken
      the dead white man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a peculiar and significant gesture&mdash;one that is not often
      used, but when it is it implies that certain matters or things must not be
      further alluded to, but must be for ever buried in oblivion. I put my hand
      on his tough, naked, and wrinkled shoulder, and again repeated my
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know of no dead white man,&rdquo; he replied, looking me steadily in the
      face, and yet answering me in his usual respectful manner. Then he sat
      down beside the low stone wall surrounding the house, and began to pluck
      the fowl, casually remarking that it was fat for its age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhat puzzled at the reticence of my servants, I walked across my
      compound towards the native village, which, as I have before mentioned,
      was some distance from my house, and as I walked I felt at every footstep
      a renewed bodily vigour, and almost unconsciously I took out my pipe,
      filled it, and began to smoke with an enjoyment denied to me for many
      months.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was gloriously bright and cool, and the westering sun on my right
      hand shone on a sea of the deepest blue, whose placid bosom was dotted by
      a fleet of canoes with their mat sails spread to the now gentle trade
      wind, cruising to and fro catching flying fish. This seemed strange to me,
      bearing in mind the events of the past few hours. The death of a white
      man, even from natural causes, was of itself generally a matter of such
      importance to the natives of any of the mid-Pacific isles, that their
      daily avocations were suspended, and the house of the deceased man would
      not only be surrounded on the outside by a circle of people sitting on
      their mats and awaiting their turn to enter and express their condolences
      with his wife or children, but filled inside as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first houses I passed on the outskirts of the village were occupied
      only by women and children, who all gave me their usual cheerful greeting
      of <i>Tiakapo, Simi!</i> (&ldquo;Good-day, Jim&rdquo;) and one or two of them added a
      few words of congratulation upon my improved appearance, and then calmly
      went on with their work, such as mat-making, mending fishing nets,
      cooking, etc., but no one of them gave the slightest indication of even
      having heard that anything unusual had occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0007" id="linkimage-0007">
      <!-- IMG --></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">
      <img src="images/062.jpg"
       alt="Directed My Steps Towards the Great Open-sided Moniep 062 "   width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      Crossing the village square&mdash;if it could be so called&mdash;I
      directed my steps towards the great open-sided <i>moniep</i>, or council
      house, from which came the sound of many voices, talking in the vociferous
      manner common to all natives of the Gilbert and Kingsmill groups. As I
      drew near I saw that there were about twenty men seated inside, smoking,
      card playing, or making cinnet for fishing lines by twisting up the
      strands of coco-nut fibre on their naked thighs. As they heard my
      footsteps on the gravel, their conversation dropped a little, but they all
      gave me <i>Tiakapo!</i> as usual, invited me to enter and sit down and
      smoke, and then went on with either their work or their pastime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; I thought, as I sat down on the mat brought to me, &ldquo;I shall get
      these fellows to tell me the meaning of all this reticence about the
      disposal of Krause's body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For some minutes I smoked in silence and took the opportunity of looking
      at my hosts. They were all either middle-aged or old men, and were all
      known to me personally, especially one old bald-headed fellow named
      Kaibuka&mdash;&ldquo;The Ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In his younger days this Kaibuka had acquired an evil reputation for being
      the instigator and leader of cutting-off attacks on whaleships and trading
      vessels, and his performances had gained him such <i>kudos</i> and respect
      from his savage associates that now in his old age he was the most
      influential of the three principal head men of the whole lagoon. Like all
      the others present, he wore but the usual <i>airiri</i>, or girdle of
      grass, round his loins, and his dark reddish-brown body was covered from
      head to waist with the scars of wounds received in earlier years. Each of
      his ear-lobes, pierced in infancy, had from long years of continuous
      distention by means of rolls of pandanus leaf, become so pendulous that
      they now hung loosely upon his shoulders in two great bights of thin flesh
      as thick as a lead pencil, though one of them had twisted in it a long
      stick of tobacco and a spare pipe. He was not, however, a bad-looking old
      ruffian, and his shining bald head, still perfect teeth, and extremely
      Jewish cast of features gave him quite a distinctive appearance from the
      younger men, whose long coarse hair, cut away across the forehead and
      hanging loosely down on their shoulders and backs, made their fierce,
      savage faces appear as if they looked at you from a moving frame of black.
      They certainly were a wild-looking lot, but their appearance somewhat
      belied their dispositions&mdash;at least as far as I was personally
      concerned. We had always got along very well together both socially and in
      business, and I was well aware that whilst they disliked and mistrusted
      Krause they placed implicit confidence in me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Putting down my pipe on the mat beside me, I told old Kaibnka that I
      desired to talk to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a dead silence at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>E rai rai</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;Good&rdquo;), he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kaibuka,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;hath the dead white man been taken to his wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked stolidly at me for an instant, and then answered with an air of
      intense surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead white man! What dead white man, Simi? <i>I</i> know of none. We saw
      no dead white man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, we know of none,&rdquo; echoed the others in unison.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began to feel both angry and uncomfortable, and showed it: but for the
      moment I was too puzzled to do more than stare at them each in turn. They
      looked straight before them as if their faces were so many stone jugs&mdash;they
      had about as much expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again I addressed myself to Kaibnka.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do ye make this pretence? Thou thyself, Kaibnka, and thou, Berau,
      were, with many others, in my house when his dead body lay on the floor.
      Why are ye all so silent? And whither have the girl Niâbon and Tematau
      gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time I got an answer&mdash;to my last question, at any rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Niâbon and Tematau have gone across the lagoon in a canoe. They desired
      to talk with the white man's wife. In a little time, as darkness falls,
      they will return to thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did <i>they</i> take the dead man with them, then?&rdquo; I persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old fellow met my inquiring glance quite calmly. &ldquo;I know of no dead
      man, Simi.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I glared angrily at them all round, and then for a moment wondered if they
      were all crazy or I alone was wrong in my head. I was rising to my feet
      with an exclamation of anger at their obstinacy when the old bald-head
      motioned me to stay. Then at a sign from him all the others gathered up
      their <i>impedimenta</i> and quietly went off in Tarions directions,
      leaving us alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simi,&rdquo; he said, coming swiftly over and crouching in front of me, &ldquo;be
      wise. Ask no one of the white man who was here yesterday; for no one will
      tell thee but Niâbon. There is death in store for many, many people, if ye
      heed not my words. Go back to thy house, and be patient and wait, and ask
      naught of any one but Niâbon of what is past. Wouldst thou see this land
      soaked in blood because of <i>one</i> man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke in such curious, whispered tones, and kept his keen hawk-like
      face so close to mine that I saw he was in deadly earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Promise me, Simi. Promise me to rest in thy house and wait for Niâbon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you will, I shall wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I walked slowly back to my house and took a stiff glass of grog to steady
      my nerves, which were beginning to feel a little upset.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's time I got out of this place,&rdquo; I thought, as, lighting my pipe, I
      went down to my boat again and busied myself in taking out all her
      fittings, examining and replacing them again.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I returned to the house for my supper it was quite dark, and just as
      my lamp was lit Niâbon entered.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      Thinking it would be wiser to refrain from asking her any questions until
      she had at least rested a little&mdash;for she seemed to be very weary&mdash;I
      said nothing to her but a few words of welcome, and bade my servants lay
      the supper, then told her that I was sure she was both hungry and tired.
      She replied that she certainly was tired, having come on foot from Taritai
      to save time. The canoe with Tematau was to follow on later in the night
      when the tide turned, and when there would be more water on the upper sand
      flats of the lagoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Niâbon,&rdquo; I said in English, &ldquo;now sit down and drink a cup of
      tea and eat a little. Then we can talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have many things of which to tell thee, Simi,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for I have
      been speaking long with the wife of the man Krause, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told her that it would please me better if she first ate something. She
      at once obeyed, but instead of sitting at the table with me she seated
      herself on a mat near me, and Pai waited upon her whilst big Tepi attended
      to me. Only once did she speak during the meal, when she asked me if I had
      had any recurrence of either fever or ague, and she was undoubtedly
      pleased when I said that I had not, and that another coarse or two of her
      medicine would, I believed, care me. She smiled, and told me she would
      make more of the mixture that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      After eating a very slight sapper she made herself a cigarette and sat and
      smoked until I had finished my pipe. Then she came a little nearer to me,
      and I felt ashamed of myself for not having asked her if her neck gave her
      much pain, for I now noticed that the neck and front of her dress were
      blood-stained. She made light of the wound, however; said it was but skin
      deep, and would be healed in a few days. But I insisted upon her letting
      me see for myself. She consented somewhat unwillingly, and I saw that she
      had had a very narrow escape, the heavy bullet from Krause's Derringer
      having scored her neck pretty deeply and made a wound nearly two inches
      long. She had, however, she told me, had it attended to by Mrs. Krause,
      who had done the very best thing that could have been done to a
      superficial injury of the kind&mdash;painted it liberally with Friar's
      Balsam, which though causing intense pain for a few minutes, had quickly
      stayed the flow of blood and prevented any inflammation from setting in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mrs. Krause well, Niàbon?&rdquo; I asked as I readjusted the bandage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she knows how her husband died?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She knows how he died, but knows not whose were the hands that dealt the
      blows. And, Simi, it is well that she does not know, for I am her friend,
      and it would grieve her did she know all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought a moment or two before answering&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can the truth be kept from her, Niâbon? There are many people who
      know 'twas thee and Tematau who slew him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>She</i> will never know, Simi,&rdquo; she asserted earnestly; &ldquo;there is but
      one man who could tell her, and him she will not ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; I asked wonderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thyself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should she not ask me? Her husband met his death in my house. I saw
      his body lying at my feet. Dost think she will fail to question <i>me</i>
      if others whom she may ask remain silent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will ask thee no questions concerning him. His death hath taken away
      from her a terror by day and bad dreams at night that for two years hath
      wrung her heart and weakened her body, which is but frail. Have pity on
      her, Simi, and say nothing to her when thou seest her of her dead husband.
      He is gone; and yet, although she wept when I told her he was dead, and
      she knelt and prayed for his spirit which has gone beyond, I know well
      that now some peace hath come into her heart. And I have given her sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke she turned her strangely sombrous and liquid eyes to mine in
      such an appealing glance that I could not resist her magnetic power,
      strive as I would.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do as you wish, Niâbon,&rdquo; I said, falling weakly into English
      again. &ldquo;You are a strange girl, but I am sure that you mean well, not
      alone to me, but to that poor heartbroken woman. But you must tell me the
      meaning of all this strange silence on the part of the people of this
      village. Why do they deny the death of Krause? How <i>can</i> they conceal
      it? It cannot possibly be hidden. There is a German man-of-war coming to
      this island soon&mdash;Mrs. Krause herself told me&mdash;and how will
      these people account to the captain for his death? You and Tematau, who
      together killed him, cannot escape. And if I am questioned&mdash;as I
      shall be&mdash;what can I do? I cannot lie about a murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was no murder, Simi,&rdquo; she said steadily, and I felt that the girl was
      but right in her assertion; &ldquo;it is no murder to strike and kill, and kill
      quickly, he who would slay the innocent and unoffending. That man was a
      devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you done with him, Niâbon? He might have been the devil you say
      he was; but he was a white man, and it is my place to see that he is
      buried as Christians bury the dead. He used me roughly, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She placed her hand on my knee, and her very touch subdued my excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simi, the man is dead, and not even a strand of his hair is left on
      earth. No one can ever question thee, or Tematau, or me, about him. He is
      gone, and even his name is already vanished from these people among whom
      he has dwelt. Dost not understand me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I do not understand, Niâbon,&rdquo; I said more gently. &ldquo;How can his name
      be vanished when but a few hours ago he was alive and well. Tell me, in
      plain English, what you mean by saying that no one can question you and
      Tematau and myself about the manner of his death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, Simi, thou and I and others shall be far away from here when the
      man's countrymen come in the fighting-ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to Heaven we were far away at this moment,&rdquo; I said impatiently. &ldquo;I
      am sick to death of the place, and don't want to find myself a prisoner on
      board a German man-of-war on suspicion of being concerned in Krause's
      death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She again repeated her assurance that I should never be questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Mrs. Krause now?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Taritai.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Niàbon&rdquo;&mdash;and I placed my hand on her head&mdash;&ldquo;you must not keep
      me in the dark about some things. I want you to answer me truly some
      questions. And, though I do not know why, I have this moment resolved to
      leave the island as quickly as possible. Would you come with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Sherry. Of course I am coming with you,&rdquo; she answered in
      English. &ldquo;I told you that you and I and some other people would soon be
      together upon the sea. And I will answer any question you ask me. I don't
      want to deceive you. Why should I try to deceive you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she turned her full, soft eyes up to my face, I saw in them such
      undoubted sincerity that I felt it was not possible for me again to doubt
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am sure you will not deceive me, Niàbon. And I want you to tell me
      straightforwardly the meaning of all this mystery. First of all, what has
      been done with the German's body? where is it buried?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the sea. It was taken far out where the water is very, very deep&mdash;three
      hundred fathoms&mdash;and the mats in which it was wrapped were weighted
      so heavily with stones that it took six men to carry it down to the
      canoe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why was this done? Why was he not buried on shore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you, Mr. Sherry. It was done so that when the German
      man-of-war comes here, no trace of him will ever be found;&rdquo; and then she
      told me frankly the whole story, and the meaning of the strange silence of
      the natives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Krause, she said, after his savage attack upon Tematau, had told his
      terrified wife that he meant to bring back Tematau, and kill Niâbon. After
      drinking heavily all night, he had started off alone in the morning, armed
      with a brace of revolvers and a Derringer pistol. He at first tried to get
      some forty or fifty of the Taritai young men to accompany him, and make a
      regular marauding expedition upon my village; but though they were eager
      to go with him and engage in battle with their old enemies, Niâbon,
      assisted by the more cautious head men, succeeded in dissuading them, and
      finally Krause went off alone. He travelled along the inner beach of the
      lagoon, and as soon as he reached my village marched boldly up to my
      house, boastfully calling out to the natives that he had come to take
      Tematau out of the Englishman's house, alive or dead&mdash;a few minutes
      later he himself was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hurried consultation was at once held by the head men, and it was
      resolved to dispose of Krause's body so effectually that no trace of it
      would ever be found, and every man, woman, and child in the village of
      Utiroa was sternly warned not only against even alluding to the manner of
      his death, but even admitting that he had even been seen by any one of
      them on that particular day. Hastily wrapping the dead man in mats, the
      body was taken out to sea, and sunk as Niâbon had described.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0008" id="linkimage-0008">

       alt="Fishing As if Nothing Unusual Had Occurred 076 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      Then the fleet of canoes from the village began fishing as if nothing
      unusual had occurred, and after they had been out some hours they were met
      by eight or ten canoes from Taritai, which were also engaged in fishing.
      The moment they were within speaking distance the Taritai men inquired
      whether Krause had fulfilled his threat, and carried Tematau away. The
      Utiroa people affected great surprise, and said that they had seen nothing
      of him, but that most probably he had thought better of doing such a
      foolish and offensive thing, and had returned to Taritai again. The two
      fleets of canoes remained together for some little time, discussing
      Krause, and then one of the Taritai men frankly admitted that he (Krause)
      had tried to induce them to make a raid on Utiroa, but that Niâbon and the
      head men had set their faces against such a wicked act of aggression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well for him then that he did not come to Utiroa to-day,&rdquo; said old
      Kaibuka's son gravely. &ldquo;Such a man as he is not wanted in our town. So
      keep him at Taritai.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Niâbon and Tematau had set out for Taritai to acquaint
      Mrs. Krause of the tragedy which had occurred. The moment they entered the
      village they were surrounded by natives, who eagerly inquired when Krause
      was returning&mdash;had he driven Tematau out of the Englishman's house?
      etc., etc. Both Niâbon and her companion expressed surprise&mdash;neither
      they nor any one else in Utiroa had seen Krause, they said, and Tematau
      had come with her to ask Mrs. Krause to try and induce her husband to let
      him leave his service. The natives accepted their story without the
      slightest doubt, and the two went on their way to the white man's house.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she and Mrs. Krause were alone Niâbon told her the cause of her
      visit and the steps which had been taken by the head men of Utiroa to
      conceal her husband's death, so that when the German warship arrived and
      found him missing, the people of Utiroa could not be, even after the most
      searching investigation, connected with his disappearance. Mrs. Krause
      quite agreed that a wise course had been taken, for were it proved that
      her husband had been killed in Utiroa, the man-of-war would certainly
      inflict a terrible punishment on the village, as was usual with German
      warships' procedure in the South Seas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then at Niâbon's suggestion she summoned the head men, and told them that
      her husband had not reached Utiroa. Something must have happened to him.
      Would they send out and search for him, and if they found him, urge him to
      return, as Tematau had come back, and there was now no occasion for him
      (Krause) to offend the people of Utiroa by entering their village armed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The head men were only too willing, and at once sent out search parties,
      and when Niàbon was coming back, she met two of them, who told her that
      they had been to Utiroa itself, but not one single person had seen
      anything of the white man, and they were now returning along the weather
      side of the island to search for him in the thick jungle, where they
      imagined he might have strayed and lost himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that is why these people here have acted so strangely, Mr. Sherry,&rdquo;
       she concluded. &ldquo;It would be terrible for them to be all killed, and the
      village burnt. For the Germans are very cruel. I have seen them do very,
      very cruel things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think the Utiroa people have done right. The German brought his death
      on himself. But I fear that the secret must come out some day. The Taritai
      people will surely suspect something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. No one of the Taritai people will ever know. By this time to-morrow
      they will all say that he has been drowned when crossing one of those
      narrow channels between the islands on the weather side, for there are
      many deep pools, and the coral sometimes breaks under the pressure of a
      man's foot. And so they will think he has fallen in one of those pools,
      and his body carried out to sea, or into the lagoon, and eaten by the
      sharks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her emphatic manner reassured me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is a bad business, Niàbon; but it cannot be helped. But I shall
      get away from here as soon as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad. And Simi, there is yet one other thing of which I have not yet
      spoken. It is of Lucia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She always called Mrs. Krause by her Christian name, as did the natives
      generally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She desires greatly to come with us in the boat. And I pray thee to be
      kind to her, else will she die here of loneliness and terror.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      This was a pretty astonishing request, and for a few seconds I gazed
      blankly at the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;she must be mad to think of such a thing! And I
      should be as equally mad to even entertain the idea of taking her with me
      in a small boat on a voyage of more than a thousand miles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, she is not mad, Simi. And she hath set her heart on this. It would
      be cruel to leave her to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to take her away would be still more cruel,&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Such a long,
      long voyage is a hard and dangerous venture even for strong men&mdash;men
      who should be both good navigators and good seamen. But a weak, delicate
      woman&mdash;oh, it's all sheer nonsense, girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put her hand on mine, and the moment I felt her warm touch, my
      impatience ceased. I would argue the thing out with her, I thought, and
      soon convince her that it would be impossible. Impossible&mdash;folly,
      utter folly. I must not think of such a thing for a moment. And yet&mdash;and
      yet&mdash;I rose from my seat, walked to the window, and then turned to
      Niâbon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis a mad idea,&rdquo; I said, trying to speak angrily, and failing
      lamentably. &ldquo;'Tis you alone, Niâbon, who hath made her ask me to do this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not true, Simi,&rdquo; she replied quietly, &ldquo;Yet when I spoke to her of
      our voyage, her heart's wishes came to her lips, and I knew that she would
      ask to come with thee, even as I know that thou wilt not leave her here to
      die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could make no answer for the time. What was coming over me, that I could
      listen to such a suggestion with patience? What a strange influence did
      this girl Niâbon possess that I, a sensible man, felt she could and would
      make me yield to her wishes, and let a sickly, delicate woman like Mrs.
      Krause accompany me on a voyage that presented nothing but danger. The
      fever must have weakened my brain, I thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then, on the other hand, Mrs. Krause was a free agent. She had no
      children. Her husband had just been killed. I, the only other white man on
      the island to whom she could look to for social intercourse at long
      intervals, was leaving the island. Her mind had been tortured, and her
      life made miserable by her brute of a husband. Could I, as a <i>man</i>,
      leave her among a community of naked savages to fret out her life? She
      wished to come with me. Well, I should tell her of the dangers&mdash;aye,
      and the horrors&mdash;of such a voyage as I was bent upon. I should
      conceal nothing from her&mdash;nothing, absolutely nothing. I should tell
      her of how the wife of the captain of the ship <i>Octavia</i>, from Sydney
      to Singapore, had seen her husband die, and the famishing crew of the boat
      which had left the burnt ship, drag his body from her with savage curses
      and threats, and&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simi.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Niabon? What would you have me do? Why do you tempt me to let
      this poor, weak lady accompany me on a voyage, which will, most likely,
      end in death to us all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be danger, but no death,&rdquo; she replied dreamily, turning her
      face away from me towards the sea, and slowly extending her arms; &ldquo;and
      thou, Simi&mdash;thou shalt gain thy heart's desire. For I have seen it
      all, even as I see it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My heart's desire! Tell me what is my heart's desire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stepped up to her and placed my hand gently on her head, and, bending
      down, saw that her eyes were closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My heart's desire, Niabon? tell me what is my heart's desire,&rdquo; I said
      again, and as I spoke I caught my breath, and tried hard to steady myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fame, Fame! The praise of men for a great deed! This is thy heart's
      desire, Simi. To do such things as were done by the three men of whom thou
      dreame&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What three men?&rdquo; I whispered, and in an instant there flashed through my
      mind the memory of the daring deeds of Jack Collier of Tahiti, of
      tousle-headed Barney Watt of the <i>Ripple</i>, and big Cameron of
      Honolulu. &ldquo;Who are the three men of whom I dream?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pressed her hands to her bosom, and then turned her face, with her
      eyes still closed, to mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know, Simi. I cannot see beyond as I can do sometimes; for I am
      tired, and many other things are in my mind. But yet I can see one man of
      the three whom thou dost so often think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, then,&rdquo; and I knelt beside the girl and looked upwards to her
      face&mdash;&ldquo;tell me of one man of the three. What is he like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simi, oh, Simi, be not too hard with me; for though I can see many faces,
      they are new and strange to me. And they quickly become faint and dim, and
      then vanish&mdash;but the sound of their voices seem to beat upon my
      closed ears&mdash;and I cannot understand, Simi, I cannot understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took her hand in mine and pressed it gently. I did not want to torment
      the poor girl, but I did want to know something more of the one man of the
      three of whom she had spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you tell me of the one man, Niâbon?&rdquo; I said gently. &ldquo;Is he young and
      strong, and of good looks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not young, but is strong, and his eyes are deep-set and stern; and
      a great red beard flows down upon his broad chest; his feet are covered
      with boots that come to the knee, and he carries a stick in his hand, for
      he is lame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I started. I <i>knew</i> whom she meant&mdash;it was Cameron of Honolulu,
      and had the man been there himself, in his rough rig-out, and leaning on
      his heavy stick as he walked, she could not have described him more
      clearly!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more shall I doubt you,&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;I will do all you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no answer, but sat with eyes still closed, and her bosom gently
      rising and falling as if she were asleep. Fearing that I should do her
      some harm if I endeavoured to rouse her from what seemed to be a trance, I
      went softly away, and with a strange feeling of exaltation tingling
      through my veins, took down my roll of charts from my book-shelf, and
      opening out No. 780&mdash;one of the four sheets embracing the North and
      South Pacific&mdash;studied it carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall do it, I shall do it,&rdquo; I said aloud, and already I fancied I
      could see my boat sailing into either Levuka or else Apia Harbour, fifteen
      hundred miles away, and hear the cheers, and see the flags run up by the
      ships in port, as I stepped out of my boat on to the beach to report
      myself to the British Consul&mdash;&ldquo;Jim Sherry, master and owner of a
      twenty-eight feet whale-boat, from Tarawa Island, in the Gilbert Group.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It <i>would</i> be an achievement, and I should become as well known as
      Cameron. But&mdash;and here my vanity received a check&mdash;Cameron
      sailed fifteen hundred miles in a poorly equipped dinghy, and yet
      succeeded in reaching Jaluit in the Marshall Islands, whilst I should have
      everything in my favour as far as equipment went.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I would do more than Cameron did, I thought. If I reached either Samoa
      or Fiji safely, I would go on across to New Caledonia, and possibly from
      there on to the east coast of Australia! That would be something that had
      never yet been done by any one in a small boat, and would make me famous
      indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      That night I was too excited to think of sleeping, so remained up and
      worked at a new jib I was making, taking care to avoid any noise, for I
      found that Niâbon was now really asleep, and I did not want to disturb
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not awaken till nearly midnight, just as Tematan returned. He
      handed me a note. It was from Mrs. Krause, asking me, if it would not be
      inconvenient to me, would I come to Taritai in the morning, as she greatly
      wished to see me on a matter of importance. I smiled at Niâbon as I read
      it, for I could easily guess what it was that the lady was so anxious to
      see me about.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started off as soon as it was daylight, and on reaching Taritai village
      found Mrs. Krause expecting me, early as it was. She was pale, but yet, I
      imagined, looking better than she had when we last met. She went into the
      subject at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Sherry, will it not be possible for you to let me go with you in the
      boat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you can come. But I tell you frankly that we may never see Samoa or
      Fiji, for the risks of such a long voyage must necessarily be very great,
      even if we have fine weather all the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face lit up with pleasure. &ldquo;It is kind of you. And you will not find
      me troublesome. I should go mad if I were left alone here, for Niâbon has
      always been such a friend to me. Whenever my husband was away, she came
      and stayed with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This allusion to her husband, I could see, pained her, and therefore,
      although I knew that several parties were out in search of him, I did not
      mention his name to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Sherry,&rdquo; she said presently, &ldquo;I have a suggestion to make. One of the
      boats belonging to this station was lost, as you know, not long ago, but
      there is another, a large one, which was sold to some natives. Would you
      like me to send for her, and if you like it better than your own, I think
      we could buy it back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knew the boat well enough by sight. She was half-decked, and although
      not a beauty to look at, was certainly a much better and safer boat than
      my own for a long voyage. I decided to inspect her, and my hostess at once
      despatched a man to the village where the boat was then lying with a
      message to the chief to bring her to Taritai. I told Mrs. Krause that if
      the boat was seaworthy she would certainly be far preferable to my own,
      and that I would buy it from the natives. And then, much against my will,
      I had to ask her what she intended doing with her husband's property when
      she left the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is one subject upon which I want your advice. Will you look at his
      account-books, and tell me his position with the firm in Hamburg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Krause had kept his books very methodically, and after taking stock of the
      little trade goods that were still unsold, and counting his cash, I was
      able to tell her pretty exactly how he stood. There was about £200 due to
      him altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you advise me to do?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as the house and all that is in it is concerned, you can do
      nothing but leave it under the care of the head men of Taritai. They will
      undertake the responsibility, and hand the station over to the first
      German ship that calls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be a man-o'-war here soon, the <i>Elizabeth</i>. At least, we
      heard that she was likely to come here some time this year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said she would be doing wisely if she remained on the island, and got
      the man-of-war captain to settle up Krause's affairs; but she shuddered
      and looked at me in such fear that I said no more, beyond remarking that
      as her husband had left no will&mdash;at least, as far as she knew&mdash;I
      feared she would have trouble in getting the amount due to him at the time
      of his death. She would probably have to go to Sydney, where there was a
      branch of the firm he was trading for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want the £200,&rdquo; she said vehemently. &ldquo;I have a little money of my
      own&mdash;about twenty dollars&mdash;and one cannot well starve anywhere
      in the South Seas. I am young and can work. I could earn my living by
      making Panama hats if I could find nothing else to do.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty dollars is not much of a stand-by in a town like Apia or Levuka,&rdquo;
       I said gravely, as I looked at her now animated features. &ldquo;Living there is
      very expensive&mdash;as I know to my sorrow&mdash;and unless you have
      friends at either place, you would have to go to an hotel in the first
      place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not afraid, Mr. Sherry. And I am not jesting about the hat-making.
      All of my mother's family were very expert at it, and quite often I have
      seen as much as twenty-five or thirty Mexican dollars paid for one of our
      hats. We could have sold ten times the number had we been able to have
      made more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was this?&rdquo; I asked, with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Agana, in the Marianas. My father lived there for many years. He was a
      very poor man, and had a hard struggle to get along with such a large
      family. So we all had to help him as much as we could. He was an
      Englishman named Arundel, and was in some Government employment in
      Rangoon. I do not remember exactly what it was, but think he was connected
      with maritime matters, for I remember that he had many nautical books, and
      used to go away frequently in the Government steamers to Perak and
      Singapore. I can scarcely remember my mother, for she died when I, who was
      the youngest of the family, was about six years old. But I think she was
      of Dutch-Javanese parentage, for sometimes she would speak to us children
      in both languages, and I remember her being very dark. Soon after she
      died, my father&mdash;who was always of a restless disposition I suppose&mdash;either
      gave up, or lost his employment in Rangoon, and taking us with him,
      settled on Tinian, in the Marianas, where he had something to do with
      cattle. But we did not remain there permanently; we were always moving
      about from one island to another&mdash;sometimes we would be living at
      Saipan, sometimes at Rota, and sometimes at Agana, in Guam. At this last
      place&mdash;which I love dearly&mdash;we were very happy, although we were
      so poor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped somewhat abruptly, and added that it was at this place she had
      met Krause, who came to the Marianas from Manila, on behalf of his firm,
      who had a large establishment at the latter city.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to see the Marianas&mdash;or the Ladrones, as we traders
      call them,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;There is a very dear friend of mine now living at San
      Anlaccio in Guam&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is his name?&rdquo; she asked quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;José Otano. He was mate of a New Bedford whaler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know him, I know him,&rdquo; she cried excitedly, &ldquo;he and his mother, and his
      two sisters&mdash;Nicolacoa and Maria. Oh, how I should love to see them
      again! I remember going to San Anlaccio with my father and an elder
      sister, and staying there for two or three months. My father was buying
      cattle for <i>tasajo</i>, and we lived with the Otano family. They were
      very kind to as, and we three little girls used to ride together on the
      water buffaloes, and one day their brother José, who I remember was a
      sailor, had to come and search for us, for we were lost in a great swamp
      between Punta de los Amantes and the stone cross of Padre Sanvitores.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those are the people,&rdquo; I said, feeling pleasurably excited myself that we
      should have mutual friends. &ldquo;I have often heard him speak of his mother
      and two sisters. And often, very often he has urged me to pay him a visit,
      and settle down with him. He says that I should not want to leave the
      Marianas once I could see what a beautiful country it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed! Ah, Mr. Sherry, 'tis indeed a beautiful country. I wonder if
      I shall ever see it again! My father, two brothers, and three of my
      sisters died of fever just before I married Krause, and there are but two
      of us left now&mdash;myself and another sister who is married to the
      Spanish doctor at San Ignacio de Agana. Oh, shall I ever see her face
      again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes sparkled, and her pale face flushed as she bent towards me with
      clasped hands: &ldquo;Oh, the mere thought of it makes me feel a young girl
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you not?&rdquo; I began, then I ceased speaking, and walked up and
      down the room thinking, and I felt my cheeks flush as a project, daring
      enough, came to my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you a big sheet chart of the Pacific&mdash;the large blue-backed
      one?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there it is in the corner beside you, with some others. But it is
      old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I spread it out on the table, and weighted down each of the four ends by
      means of books, so as to get a good view.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0009" id="linkimage-0009">

    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here, Mrs. Krause, and look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She came over to me, and then her thin little hand followed my forefinger
      as I made a pencilled mark on the chart to the south-east.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is Tarawa; here is Apia in Samoa, nearly fifteen hundred miles
      distant. Here is the island of Ovalau in Fiji, about the same distance. Do
      you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here, north-west from Tarawa, is your home on Guam&mdash;more than
      two thousand miles away. 'Tis a long, long way&mdash;but it could be
      done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A long, long way indeed.&rdquo; She lifted her eyes to me&mdash;and then she
      placed her hand on mine. &ldquo;Why do you smile, Mr. Sherry; and yet why say
      'it could be done'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us sit down and talk the matter over quietly;&rdquo; and I led her to a
      seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should we go to Fiji or Samoa?&rdquo; I said quickly, my blood afire with
      my new project. &ldquo;There is nothing to draw you thither, is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. I know no one at either place. But you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I! It matters but little to me where I go. But I am sick to death of this
      island, and long to be doing something. I am a man without a home, without
      ties, a wandering South Sea deadbeat&mdash;no friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not say that,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;I am sure you have many
      friends. Just now you spoke of one&mdash;José Otano.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, I did; but I meant friends in Europe, in the outer and greater world&mdash;people
      who care for, who even give me a passing thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is sad, indeed. Oh, it must be sad to be alone, quite, quite alone
      in the world. And I am very, very sorry for you, Mr. Sherry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The deep ring of sympathy in her voice warmed my heart to the little
      woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Krause,&rdquo; I said&mdash;and I spoke quietly, &ldquo;you are a brave woman,
      else you would not dare to come with me in a small boat to so distant a
      place as Fiji or Samoa. But will you be braver still, and risk your life
      in a still more dangerous enterprise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, indeed, Mr. Sherry. I have no sense of the fear of death&mdash;none,
      absolutely none,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let us give up the idea of Fiji,&rdquo; I cried, catching her hand, &ldquo;let
      us go to the north-west&mdash;to Guam, to your own home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; and she gave a low gasp of pleasure. &ldquo;Oh, yes, indeed, it will be a
      wonderful voyage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if we ever get there,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But we can try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not fail. Of that I am as sure as I am of my own existence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again we turned to the chart, and were poring over it together when the
      messenger returned to say that the natives had arrived with the boat. I
      hurried down to the beach, and saw the native owners, and then the boat
      itself, which, after very little trouble, I bought for ten muskets, a
      couple of tierces of tobacco, and a hundred fathoms of red turkey twill.
      Then, after giving them some instructions, I went back to the house.
    </p>

      <img src="images/096.jpg" alt="I Hurried Down to the Beach 096 "   width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Sherry, what do you think of the boat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fairly well, Mrs. Krause. Anyway, I've bought her, and if you look out of
      the window, you'll see the crew getting her under way again to sail her
      over to Utiroa. Now I must get home, for there will be much to do. The
      first thing that I must get done is to alter my own boat's mainsail and
      jib, and make them large enough for my new ship, whose sails are quite
      rotten. Then I shall make an extra new suit as well. I'll set Niâbon to
      work to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, let me help! <i>Do</i>. It would give me such real pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I shall be very glad of your assistance. I can cut out the new
      suit, and you and Niâbon sew them. It will only be very light material,
      but, for all that, may make your fingers suffer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mind if it does&mdash;neither of your sail-makers will grumble,&rdquo;
       she said brightly. &ldquo;When shall I come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow. I'll send the whale-boat for you. You will find mine an untidy
      house, and Tepi a great cook&mdash;as far as size goes. He stands six
      feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so with a laugh, and lighter hearts than had been ours for many a long
      day, we said goodbye till the morrow.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      As soon as I arrived at Utiroa village with my new boat, I had her hauled
      up above high-water mark, close to the boat-shed, and then turned her over
      so as to get a good look at the bottom in the morning. Then without
      telling either Tematau or Niâbon the reason for my purchase, I bade them
      open my trade-room door, and in a few minutes we were engaged in paying
      the late owners their tobacco, guns, ammunition, and bolts of turkey
      twill. They were well satisfied with the price I paid them, especially
      when I supplemented it with the gift of a case of biscuit and a case of
      tinned Australian meats, of which I had an ample stock. They were very
      much disposed to remain in the house and give my servants their view of
      the cause of Krause's strange disappearance, which was&mdash;as they had
      previously told me&mdash;that he had been seized and devoured by an
      enormous reptile, half eel and half turtle, which had been known to
      swallow not only human beings, but such trifles as double canoes, groves
      of coco-nut trees, etcetera; but on my telling them that I was very tired
      and wanted a quiet house, they retired to the native village to spend the
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calling Niâbon and Tematau to me, I told them why I had bought the boat.
      They both seemed very pleased, but somewhat to my astonishment showed no
      surprise at the change in my plans; and for a moment or two a swift
      suspicion crossed my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did they&mdash;or Niâbon at least&mdash;<i>know</i> that it was Mrs.
      Krause who had brought this boat to my notice? Had Mrs. Krause said
      anything on the matter to Niâbon herself? I determined to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Niâbon,&rdquo; I said in English, which Tematau also understood fairly well,
      though he never spoke it, &ldquo;tell me truly&mdash;did you or Tematau ever
      speak to Lucia of this boat which I have just bought?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, never, Mr. Sherry,&rdquo; she replied calmly, and the quiet dark eyes met
      mine with such an expression of truthfulness that I was instantly ashamed
      of my transitory suspicion. &ldquo;I have never spoken to her about this boat,
      and never has Tematau, I am sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, it was a very lucky thought of hers,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;we have now a
      boat that will be much better than my own, which I must try and sell, for
      we shall want money, Niâbon, we shall want money badly in the strange
      country to which we are going, and I have but little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kaibuka and the head men will buy the other boat, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; I said in surprise, for I had never even been
      approached on the subject of selling my boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will ask them to buy it,&rdquo; she replied, with a smile. &ldquo;I will go to them
      now, if you wish. How much money do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boat is worth two hundred dollars, but I will take one hundred. If
      they cannot give me one hundred dollars I will take no less&mdash;but
      because they and I are good friends, I will give it to them freely, for it
      will be of no further use to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will buy the boat,&rdquo; she said confidently, and lighting her
      cigarette, she went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quarter of an hour later she returned, accompanied by old Kaibuka and
      another head man. Each of them carried a small bag of money, which they
      handed to me, and simply observing that it was the price of the boat, sat
      down and waited for me to count the coins. I found there were two hundred
      dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are one hundred dollars more than the price I asked,&rdquo; I said,
      pushing one-half of the money apart. &ldquo;The boat is well worth the two
      hundred; for she is but new, and cost me more than that. But one hundred
      is all I asked for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hawk-eyed Kaibuka&mdash;one of the most avaricious old fellows I had ever
      met with in the South Seas&mdash;shook his head and said I was trying to
      wrong myself. The people would be glad to get such a fine boat for two
      hundred dollars, and that if he and the other head men announced that I
      had parted with her for a hundred dollars, the entire population of Utiroa
      would arise as one man and curse them as mean creatures; also they (the
      people) would refuse to use the boat, and he, Kaibuka, would be regarded
      as a hog&mdash;a man devoid of gratitude to the white man who had been
      kind to and had not cheated them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the money, Mr. Sherry,&rdquo; said Niàbon in English; &ldquo;they are glad to
      get the boat; and if I had said you wanted five, instead of one hundred
      dollars, they would give it. I would <i>make</i> them give it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Niâbon. I'll take it. But as it is more than I ought to expect
      under the circumstances, I will give them half a tierce of tobacco as a <i>mea
      alofa</i> (a gift of friendship).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means that you give them a hundred and twenty-five dollars' worth of
      tobacco as a present,&rdquo; she said, with an amused smile, &ldquo;and so you sell
      your beautiful boat for seventy-five dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind my extravagance, Niâbon,&rdquo; I said, in the same spirit; &ldquo;the one
      hundred and twenty-five pounds of tobacco in the half-tierce, which only
      cost me a quarter of a dollar a pound, is better given away to these
      people than left here to rot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed it is,&rdquo; she replied, as she watched Tepi and Pai roll out the
      half-tierce of the beloved tobacco from my trade-room into that in which
      we were sitting; &ldquo;these people here will never forget you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as old Kaibuka and the other head man had left&mdash;each after
      taking a stiff glass of grog&mdash;and the house was again quiet, Niâbon,
      Tepi, and I set to work to take stock, they calling out the various
      articles of my trade goods whilst I made out the list. We worked at this
      throughout the night, had an early breakfast, and then went at it again,
      and by nine o'clock the work was over, and I knew how I stood with my
      employers financially.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was pretty satisfactory, considering the short time I had been on the
      island; for with my salary of ten pounds a month, and the five per cent,
      commission I was allowed on all the goods I sold, there were over three
      hundred pounds due to me. Then, in addition to my cash takings, which came
      to over three thousand dollars, I had bought over a hundred tons of copra
      (dried coco-nut) at a very low price, paying for it with trade goods&mdash;muskets,
      rifles, ammunition, tobacco, and liquor&mdash;on which latter article my
      esteemed employers made something like a thousand per cent, profit. Of
      course I had had a big pull over Krause, whose stock of trade was almost
      exhausted when I landed, whilst I had come ashore with half a
      schooner-load. But apart from this, it was a fillip to my vanity to think
      that even if Krause had had his store packed from floor to roof with
      trade, the natives would rather have come to me than to him, for as I have
      said, they all&mdash;even those in his own village of Taritai&mdash;disliked
      him for his domineering German-like manner, and his contemptuous disregard
      of their feelings, whilst I was <i>persona grata</i> with them from the
      day I landed. But I had never yet, in all my ten years' experience of the
      South Seas, either seen, or heard, of any &ldquo;Dutchman&rdquo;&mdash;as we English
      and American traders call all Teutons&mdash;who was liked by the natives.
    </p>
    <p>
      I closed up my account-books, and, lighting my pipe, considered the
      situation. Firstly, I was certainly breaking my engagement with my
      employers by leaving the island without giving them &ldquo;due notice of one
      month&rdquo;; but as I could only communicate with them once in eight months,
      when they sent a ship round the group, that particular item in my
      agreement did not disturb my mind to any great extent. Secondly, there was
      a nice little sum of money due to me&mdash;oyer three hundred pounds&mdash;which
      in all probability I should never get if I awaited my firm's good pleasure
      to pay me, unless I went to Sydney and brought legal pressure to bear on
      them. Would not I be perfectly justified in paying myself my salary and
      commission out of the money in my possession? They would certainly look on
      me as an ass of the first water if I did not&mdash;of that I was sure. But
      again, I must not leave it in their power to say that &ldquo;Jim Sherry had
      bolted from Tarawa,&rdquo; and had not acted squarely with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Niâbon, I knew, could both read and write English fairly, so of course
      could Mrs. Krause. The latter would be at Utiroa in a few hours, and
      instead of starting them at sewing sails I would get them to make an exact
      copy of every entry in the station books from the day I took charge to the
      day we left the island. This copy I would leave behind, and take the books
      themselves with me. The idea was a good one, and later on I was glad it
      occurred to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whaleboat was my own, and as I thought of her, I felt pleased that my
      employers, who were as mean as Polish Jews, would not get to windward of
      me as far as she was concerned. I had bought her from the captain of an
      American whaler, intending her for my own personal use and pleasure as a
      fishing boat, naturally expecting that the firm would provide me with a
      boat for trading purposes, <i>i.e.</i>, to send around the lagoon and
      collect copra. The boss supercargo, however, who had drawn up the
      agreement, refused to do so, on the grounds that I had a boat already, and
      I was too weak and too racked with the damnable pains of fever to make
      more than a brief protest against what was certainly a very mean trick.
      But I had now sold her to the natives, and old Kaibuka was not a man to be
      trifled with. If any supercargo or captain of the firm endeavoured to
      claim her as property belonging to Utiroa Station, there would be such a
      blazing row that the firm would not forget it&mdash;they could never again
      land a trader on the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided to at least take a hundred pounds out of the station cash&mdash;less
      than a third of the amount due to me. This, with the two hundred dollars I
      had received from old Kaibuka, would make seven hundred dollars&mdash;something
      better than poor little Mrs. Krause's twenty, I thought with a smile. And
      I meant that she&mdash;if we succeeded in reaching Guam&mdash;should land
      there with five hundred American dollars, not Chili or Bolivian half-iron
      rubbish, but good honest silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon Mrs. Krause arrived in my old whaleboat, which I had borrowed from
      the new owners, and sent away at daylight, and whilst she and Niâbon set
      to work at copying the books, I, with Tepi, began cutting out the new suit
      of sails from a bolt of light but very strong American twill&mdash;-just
      the very stuff for boat sails, as strong as No. 1 canvas and four times
      lighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the first of eight or ten very pleasant days we spent together,
      it taking us all that time to complete our preparations; for after the
      sails were finished I had to rig the boat anew, caulk her decks, and make
      a proper cabin amidships for the two women. This would have taken me more
      than another week had it not been for a couple of native boatbuilders,
      whom old Kaibuka had sent to me. They were good workmen, though neither
      had ever handled such a thing as a plane or saw in his life&mdash;everything
      was done either with a hatchet or a <i>toki</i>&mdash;a plane-iron or a
      broad chisel lashed to a wooden handle in such a manner that it was used
      as an adze.

    <p>
      Then I gave her two good coatings of red lead from keel to above
      water-line, and above that painted her white. The people from whom I had
      bought her told me frankly that she was a poor sailer, and I quite
      believed them, for she was altogether too heavily built for her size&mdash;her
      timbers and planking being of German oak. Her mast, too, had been placed
      too far for'ard, and so I shifted it eighteen inches or two feet further
      aft. But heavy and clumsy-looking as she was, I was sure she would prove a
      good sea boat, for she had great beam and a corresponding floor&mdash;in
      fact, rather too much for her length. However, when I had finished with
      and launched her, we made a trial trip over to Mrs. Krause's station, and
      I was well satisfied with her. She sailed much better than she did
      formerly, owing to the mast being further aft, and her new mainsail and
      jib, though smaller than the old ones, setting better.

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      On our reaching Taritai, Mrs. Krause sent for the head men and told them
      that she was now satisfied that her husband was dead. What did they think?
      she asked. They replied that there could be not the slightest doubt of it.
      Every islet of the whole chain encompassing the lagoon had been searched,
      but not the slightest trace of the missing man had been found. He was
      dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she told them that as I was leaving the island, and she did not care
      to remain now that her husband was dead, she had decided to go away with
      me and my party. The trading station itself, and all her late husband's
      property, she would leave in their care, to hand over to the captain of
      the next German ship that came to take away the copra and oil that he had
      bought. And as it might be many months before a ship did come, she would
      pay them in advance for their caretaking; and also leave a letter with
      them for the captain, asking him to make them a further present, as she
      knew they were good men and would be true to their trust. Let them,
      to-morrow, come and choose from the store goods to the value of two
      hundred dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The head men were delighted, and one of them, in his exuberance, expressed
      the sorrow they all felt at her leaving them; but no doubt, he said, she
      and I were going to some island where there was a missionary, so that we
      might be married according to the customs of white people. Perhaps,
      however, we would return.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor little woman turned scarlet, and I shot a furious glance at the
      offender, and sharply told him that he was talking like a child instead of
      a grown man, and that his words had hurt the lady greatly. He put his hand
      over his eyes and collapsed. Then after a little further talk with them,
      we sent them away, and I arranged with Mrs. Krause to send the whaleboat
      for her on the following morning; for, all going well, we should start at
      sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I left her, she asked me, with a nervous tremor in her voice, to
      read the letter she had written, and if I thought it would do, or needed
      to be altered in any way. It was a letter which I had suggested she should
      write and leave with the head men. It was addressed to &ldquo;The captain or
      supercargo of any ship belonging to Messrs. G&mdash;&mdash;, of Hamburg,&rdquo;
       and contained but a few lines, stating that her husband, &ldquo;Ferdinand Alexis
      Krause, left this station on the 27th July last for Mr. James Sherry's
      station at Utiroa village, and has not since been seen, and although a
      most careful search has been made, no trace of him has been found, and the
      natives are of the opinion that he was drowned between here and Utiroa in
      crossing one of the channels between the islets. As I am not equal to the
      task of carrying on my late husband's trading business, and an opportunity
      of leaving the island presents itself to me, through the kindness of Mr.
      Sherry, a trader here, I have placed this station in the care of the head
      men. I have given them two hundred dollars in trade goods, and trust you
      will be so satisfied with their integrity and their care of the property I
      have entrusted to their charge, that you will make them a further present.
      I make no claim whatever on the money due to my husband, and will feel
      glad if you will see that it is sent to his relatives in Germany.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do very well,&rdquo; I said, as I took her hand; &ldquo;now, goodbye till
      to-morrow evening, Mrs. Krause. By this time to-morrow we should be
      getting under way. And, do you mind?&mdash;I have called the boat the <i>Lucia</i>&mdash;in
      fact I've painted the name on both bows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I am very proud. And why don't you call <i>me</i> Lucia, too, Mr.
      Sherry? Every one else does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; I said, with a laugh, &ldquo;I will talk Tarawan to you: Tiâkâpo,
      Lucia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tiâkâpo, Simi;&rdquo; and her voice was pleasant and sweet to hear, although
      the word <i>tiakako</i> meant nothing more than &ldquo;good-night.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Everything was ready at last, water, stores, arms, and ammunition, and the
      boat, with mainsail and jib hoisted, was lying just abreast of the
      station, in charge of Tematan and Tepi, surrounded by canoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the house with me were Mrs. Krause and Niâbon; and Kaibuka and his head
      men, who had come to take formal charge of the station, and to bid us
      farewell. I handed old Kaibuka letters to be given to the supercargo of
      the firm's next vessel, presented him and his colleagues with a new musket
      each, together with powder and bullets, and a small case of tobacco, and
      then we all went outside, and I locked the door formally, and handed him
      the key. He took it, unlocked the door, went inside a few steps, and then
      it was locked a second time, the key twisted in one of his pendant
      ear-lobes, and the ceremony was over. Then we all trooped down to the
      beach together, got into a canoe, and went on board.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      Shaking hands with old Kaibuka and the rest of the natives who swarmed
      around us to say farewell, I told Tepi to lift the anchor, and in another
      five minutes the little craft began to move through the water towards the
      reef, accompanied by thirty or forty canoes and native boats under sail,
      all packed with natives of both sexes, shouting their farewells, and
      wishing us good fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      By sunset we had crossed over the wide, submerged reef, which for twenty
      miles runs due north and south on the lee side of Tarawa Lagoon, and
      hauling up to the wind just as darkness fell, we soon lost sight of our
      island friends, though we could still hear them shouting our names&mdash;&ldquo;Simi,&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Niâbon,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lucia,&rdquo; for some little time after.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was dark, but fine, and the light southeasterly breeze sent us
      along at about three knots over a very smooth sea. Tepi was standing
      for'ard on the lookout, for fear we might run into any fishing canoes from
      Taritai, Tematau was busying himself about our miniature galley, my two
      women passengers were rearranging their little cabin, and I steered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here we are at last, Mrs. Krause &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; I began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucia, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we are at last, Lucia, then. I'm going to run along like this all
      night, until we get to the little island at the north end, and then put
      these gruntors ashore,&rdquo; and I pointed to half a dozen pigs which were
      lying tied up on the deck. They had, with about fifty or sixty fowls, been
      presented to us by the natives, and as we should have given great offence
      by not accepting them, we had to endure their company for the present.
      Then all around us, stowed in every conceivable place, were bundles of
      young drinking coco-nuts, husked and unhusked, taking up a great deal of
      room, and weighing heavily, and three or four rolls of sleeping-mats,
      presented to Niâbon, were wedged into the cabin. All this collection would
      have to be either got rid of entirely or largely reduced, so I decided to
      bring up at the little islet of which I had spoken, and overhaul and
      re-stow the boat by daylight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look astern,&rdquo; cried Lucia, as I shall now call her; &ldquo;isn't it pretty? And
      see, there is another fleet ahead of us, and much nearer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0013" id="linkimage-0013">

    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">
      <img src="images/120.jpg" alt="Began Their Flying-fish Catching 120 "   width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      The canoes we had left behind us had begun their flying-fish catching, and
      a long line of brightly burning, isolated flames was lighting up the sea
      all around, revealing the dark bodies of the fishers, with four paddles
      sending each canoe through the water, while in the bows stood a fifth,
      sweeping the water deftly with a scoop net attached to a pole twelve feet
      in length, his movements guided by a huge torch or flare of dried coco-nut
      leaves, held aloft by a naked boy standing on the canoe platform
      amidships. It was indeed a pretty sight, for at times the long line of
      fires would make a graceful sweeping curve, and then almost unite in a
      circle, then again open out with a fan-like movement, and advance once
      more. We watched the fleet astern a little while, and then found ourselves
      in the midst of the one we had seen ahead. There were over fifty canoes,
      all manned by Taritai people. They hailed us vociferously, wished us good
      luck, and as we sailed through their blazing lines of fire they threw so
      many flying-fish on board that not only the decks were covered, but
      hundreds, striking against the mainsail, fell into the cabin, and lay
      there like moving bars of brightest silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Tiàkako, Simi! Tiàkapo, Lucia! Tiàkapo, Niàbon!</i>&rdquo; they shouted to
      us, as we drew away from them, after throwing them some tobacco.
    </p>
    <p>
      By daylight we were abreast of the islet, and due north of us could just
      see the tops of the coco-nuts on Apaian Lagoon showing above the sea-line,
      ten miles distant, and then, to our annoyance, the wind died away, and
      there was every indication of there being a dead calm till the evening.
      However, it could not be helped, so we pulled in right up to the beach,
      and let the two women step ashore to get breakfast ready. Tepi, picking
      out the youngest and fattest of the pigs, knocked it on the head, and
      cutting the thongs of the others tumbled them over the side. They soon
      recovered themselves, and went off. Then followed a massacre of a dozen of
      the fowls, the liberation of the rest, and the throwing away of the
      greater portion of the heavy coconuts. The bundles of mats I threw ashore
      to Niâbon, as they would be useless to shield us from the rain which might
      fall during our stay on the island, and then we set to and washed down
      decks, made everything snug, and went ashore for breakfast, well satisfied
      with our work, and with the fact that the boat was six inches higher out
      of the Water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The islet, though small, was unusually fertile for so low-lying a spot&mdash;it
      being in no part more than fifteen feet above high-water mark&mdash;for in
      addition to the inevitable coco-palms, which grew thickly from the water's
      edge, there were hundreds of fine trees, among them being some noble and
      imposing jack-fruits, whose broad, bright green branches were almost level
      with the crowns of the palm-trees, their roots embedded in a rich, soft,
      black soil, formed by the fallen leaves of hundreds of years, mixed with
      decayed coral detritus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Niâbon had spread the mats in a shady spot, and we all made a simple but
      hearty breakfast of grilled fowls, biscuit, and young coco-nuts. Then we
      lit our pipes and cigarettes of the good, strong black tobacco, and
      watched a shoal of fish leaping and playing about the boat, which, with
      loose, pendant cable, lay floating on a sea as smooth and as shining as a
      polished mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      The island, so Niâbon told me, had not been inhabited for a great number
      of years, though it was occasionally visited by natives for the purpose of
      collecting the ripe coco-nuts, and turning them into oil, and sometimes
      the white traders, living on Apaian, would stop there when they were on
      their way to Tarawa and Maiana Lagoons. The name of the island, she said,
      was Te Mata Toto (&ldquo;The Bloody Eye&rdquo;). &ldquo;Why such a name?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;I will
      tell you some other time,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;not now, because I do not want
      Tepi to hear me talking about the place. With Tematau it would not matter,
      for although he knows the story, he is not a Tarawa man, and has nothing
      of which he need be afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We sat talking together for some little time, and as I looked at Lucia I
      could not but wonder at the marvellous manner in which she was recovering
      her health and strength. Her pallor, once so very manifest, had
      disappeared, as well as her languid step, and at this moment she was
      merrily reproving Tepi for smoking a pipe so old and dirty and so short in
      the stem that it was burning his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The big man grinned, and said it was a lucky pipe. For when it was white,
      new, and long, and he was smoking it for the first time, he, with two
      other men, was fishing from a canoe, it fell from his mouth into the sea,
      and before he could dive for it was swallowed by a <i>kura</i> (rock-cod).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How know you?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because my mother found it in the belly of one of those we caught, when
      she was cooking it,&rdquo; he replied promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Niâbon, who knew exactly to the smallest detail where everything
      was stowed in the boat, told him to look in one of the stern lockers for
      the fishing tackle, where he would find a small hand casting net, with
      which he and Tematau could go catch some grey mullet, while she, Lucia,
      and myself, walked round the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bringing my gun with me&mdash;for there were great numbers of small golden
      plover flying past us towards the sand patches now being revealed by the
      ebbing tide, we started off, Niâbon leading, and conducting us directly
      towards the centre of the islet, which was less than three-quarters of a
      mile from shore to shore, and was the northernmost of a chain of five or
      six, almost connected with each other at low water, and forming the
      northern horn of the lagoon. À short walk brought us to a small cleared
      space, enclosed by some heavy timber. The ground was devoid of any foliage
      with the exception of some straggling, thorny bushes, growing up between
      the layers of what seemed to be a solid bed of coral slabs cast up by the
      action of the sea during heavy storms long years before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was once a deep hole and was used as a well, long, long ago,&rdquo; said
      Niâbon, &ldquo;but the bones of seven white men lie there under the stones.
      Their bodies were thrown into the well, and then for two days some of the
      people of Tarawa threw stones upon them till the hole, which was five
      fathoms across from its sloping banks, and a fathom and a half down to
      where the fresh water lay, was filled, and only a flat surface of stones
      was to be seen. Come, let us get away to the other side, for the air here
      is hot and foul from the smell of the damp soil underneath these big
      trees. It is never dry, for the sun cannot get to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We gladly followed her, and soon reached the other side of the island,
      which faced the lagoon, of which we had a glorious view as far as eye
      could see. Then Niâbon told us the story of the well&mdash;a story that,
      horrible as it was, was but a counterpart of many such tragedies which had
      taken place all over the North and South Pacific, more especially after
      the settlement of New South Wales, in 1788, and when sandal-wooding and
      whaling brought hundreds of ships into the South Seas, the former being
      too often manned and commanded by some of the greatest ruffians who ever
      dangled from the end of a rope.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story was told to her by old Kaibuka, who himself had participated in
      the massacre, which had been planned and executed under the direct
      supervision of his father, his uncle, and himself. And it was not the only
      such affair in which he had been concerned&mdash;not on Tarawa alone, but
      on the neighbouring lagoon of Maiana. From Niâbon he had concealed nothing
      of his past life, and I honestly believe could not have done so had she
      wished otherwise, for the old fellow showed his respect and fear for her
      and her powers of &ldquo;seeing beyond&rdquo; to the same degree as did every other
      one of his people&mdash;man, woman, or child. Niâbon imagined that this
      particular case of cutting-off occurred about forty or fifty years
      previously, for Kaibuka told her that although he was young at the time,
      he was yet a full-grown man; but as he could not even guess at his present
      age, she had no very reliable data.
    </p>
    <p>
      This island, he told her, was called Te Mata Toto (The Bloody Eye of the
      Land) from its being the northern eye or point of the lagoon, from which a
      watch was always kept in olden times to give warning to the inhabitants of
      the large villages on the opposite side of the approach of their
      hereditary enemies&mdash;the people of Apaian. The moment a fleet of
      canoes were seen crossing the ocean strait which divides the two islands,
      signal fires, always kept in readiness, were lit, and the villages would
      prepare to resist the invaders, who sometimes, however, would content
      themselves with an assault on the outpost stationed on the little island.
      As they generally outnumbered the defenders by ten to one, there was
      usually but one result&mdash;every one of the garrison was slaughtered,
      and the victors, after stripping the dead bodies of their valued armour of
      coco-nut fibre, and destroying their canoes and houses, would return to
      Apaian satisfied. For this reason&mdash;i.e., the many sanguinary
      encounters which took place on the little island&mdash;it was given its
      ominous name.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Kaibuka was sent to command a party of ten men who formed the
      garrison and who were keeping a keen watch&mdash;for a raid was again
      expected&mdash;when a small, square-rigged vessel was seen heading for the
      island.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0014" id="linkimage-0014">

      <img src="images/126.jpg" alt="She Came Boldly on 126 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      She came boldly on, and dropped anchor close to the shore, lowered a boat,
      and five men came on shore. They were all armed, and at first were
      cautious about advancing up the beach to Kaibuka and his men, but seeing
      that the latter possessed no firearms, they came on, and Kaibuka, throwing
      down his club and spear, walked down and shook hands with them in a very
      friendly manner, and was at once addressed by one of them in the Gilbert
      Island tongue, though he could not speak it very well. He told Kaibuka
      that the ship was going to China, and that he was a passenger; that he had
      been living on Temana (an island far to the south-east) but had tired of
      it, and so, when the ship called there to get some food, of which she was
      badly in want, he came away with her, the captain, in return for his
      services as interpreter, promising to give him a passage to the island of
      Makin, where were living four or five white men. He then asked Kaibuka if
      there was any drinking water on the little island, and any food&mdash;of
      any kind whatever&mdash;to be obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The white men were at once taken and shown the well, at which they were
      very pleased, and two of them went back to the ship for water-casks, the
      others remaining on shore bartering with Kaibuka's people for some fish, a
      turtle, and coco-nuts, paying for them in tobacco and knives, and
      promising them a keg of rum if twenty turtle and a boat-load of full-grown
      coco-nuts were brought them within a few days. Turtle, however, were
      scarce, but Kaibuka said that there were a good many captive ones in the
      turtle ponds at the main village, and he would send over for some. And
      then his brain began to work. He suggested that two or three of the white
      men should go with his messenger; but they were too wary, and made
      excuses, which Kaibuka took in seeming good part, saying it did not
      matter, but that he would send a man over at once to his father to tell
      him to bring as many turtle as could be obtained. The captain and
      interpreter were satisfied with this, and returned on board, declining to
      let any of the curious natives come with them&mdash;on the plea that they
      would be too busy repairing some water-casks which they hoped Kaibuka and
      his men would help fill in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the young chief called to his messenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell my father and my uncle that I can see but seven men altogether on
      the ship, but each one carries a gun, pistol, and cutlass, and two are
      always on guard. Tell him, too, to bring some turtle and fish, and let
      some young women who can dance well come with him as well. But my uncle
      and some of our best men must follow in their canoes at night, and make no
      noise. They must land and hide in the bush, and stay there till my father
      speaks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Early on the following morning the captain again landed, and was pleased
      to find Kaibuka's father, accompanied by some unarmed men and eight or ten
      handsome young women, awaiting him on the beach. He had, he said, brought
      but five turtle that day, but would fetch an equal number or more on the
      morrow if they could be obtained. The captain was pleased. Fresh food, he
      said, he was very anxious to obtain, as they had nothing on board but salt
      beef and mouldy biscuit. He gave old Takai (Kaibuka's father) some
      tobacco, and a knife, and said that the young women might go on board and
      dance for the amusement of the sailors. This was exactly what the old man
      desired, for he could, from them, obtain definite information as to the
      condition of affairs on board the ship, for it was very evident that the
      captain was determined not to be led into fancied security by the friendly
      demeanour of the natives, but meant to keep himself and crew well prepared
      to resist a surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time the young Kaibuka and the interpreter&mdash;the white man
      from Temana&mdash;had become quite friendly, and that evening, whilst the
      young women were still on board, he came on shore alone, and calling
      Kaibuka aside from the other natives, said he wanted to speak to him
      privately. As soon as they were alone, he boldly avowed his intention of
      capturing the ship, and murdering all the other white men if Kaibuka and
      his people would assist him. The matter, he said, could be easily done. He
      and some other white men&mdash;two of whom were now living at Makin Island&mdash;had
      once stolen a ship when they were prisoners in Van Diemen's Land, had
      killed five or six soldiers and some of the crew, and sailed away with her
      to Fiji; and they had got much plunder from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is to be got from <i>this</i> ship?&rdquo; asked Kaibuka, who had heard
      this particular story from some traders and knew it to be true.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Casks and casks of rum, and kegs of powder and bullets, hundreds of
      muskets, swords, knives, and axes and beads&mdash;all that man can want&mdash;for
      this ship is going to a far-off cold country to barter these things for
      furs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kaibuka then inquired what share of the plunder he and his people should
      have if they captured the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half, replied the white man. Half of everything that was in the ship's
      hold and in the cabin, except some small square boxes of silver money&mdash;ten
      in all&mdash;for which he (Kaibuka) would have no use. And he could have
      two of the four big guns on the deck if he wished; but the ship herself
      was not to be harmed, nor any of her sails or rigging taken away. And
      Kaibuka would lend him two or three men to sail her to Makin, where he
      (the white man) would reward them well, and where they could remain till
      some ship brought them back to Tarawa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall be done,&rdquo; said the young man; &ldquo;come with me to my father and his
      brother, so that we may talk together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The murderous plot was soon arranged between the three, and the
      treacherous convict went off on board again to tell the unsuspecting
      captain that the old chief was anxious that he (the master) would let some
      of his men come on shore in the morning with axes and cut down a very
      large tree growing near the well. It was too great an undertaking for the
      natives with their poor tools&mdash;it would take them a week, but the
      sailors could do it in half a day. Old Takai wanted the tree cut down so
      as to build a large canoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor captain fell into the trap, the interpreter assuring him that the
      natives would not dream of attempting any mischief. Were not some of the
      young women still on board? he asked, which was a proof of the amicable
      intentions of the old chief and his people. Furthermore, he added, all the
      men had that night returned to the mainland to secure more turtle, and
      only the young women, a few boys, and the chief himself remained on the
      island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the morning the captain came on shore with three men, to fell the
      tree, leaving two only on board, with orders to be on their guard if he
      fired a shot, or they suspected anything was wrong. The interpreter
      accompanied him, and to show his confidence in the islanders he
      ostentatiously, but with seeming carelessness, threw his arms down at the
      foot of a tree, remarking to the captain that the old chief and boys and
      women seemed rather frightened at the sight of four armed white men, who
      also carried axes. Somewhat unwillingly the captain and his men followed
      suit, and then even permitted the children to carry their axes for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interpreter walked on ahead with the old chief, apparently talking on
      nothing of importance, but in reality telling him with great glee of how
      he had succeeded in lulling the captain's suspicions. Presently the whole
      party reached the thicket in which the well was situated, and as the path
      was narrow they had to walk in single file, the children who were carrying
      the axes falling behind. And then suddenly, and almost without a sound,
      thirty or more stalwart savages, led by the young Kaibuka and his uncle,
      leapt on the unsuspecting white men, who in a few seconds were clubbed to
      death before even they could utter a cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for the two on the ship,&rdquo; cried the renegade to young Raibuka; &ldquo;go,
      one of you women, down to the shore, near the ship, and cast a stone into
      the water as if at a fish, and the women on board, who are watching, will
      kill them as easily as we have killed these.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he turned, an axe was raised and buried in his brain, and he pitched
      head foremost down the bank into the well&mdash;dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him lie there,&rdquo; said one of the leaders; &ldquo;throw the others after him,
      and wait for two more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two poor seamen on board the ship were ruthlessly slaughtered by the
      women in a similarly treacherous manner, their bodies brought on shore,
      thrown down into the well with those of their shipmates and the renegade,
      and the whole depression filled with sand and coral slabs, till it was
      level with the surrounding soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst this was being done by one lot of savages, another was looting the
      vessel of her cargo of trade goods, which was rapidly transferred in
      canoes to the mainland. Then, as her capturers feared to set fire to her,
      knowing that the blaze would be seen by the natives of Apaian, ten miles
      away, they managed to slip her cable, after cutting a large hole in her
      side at the water-line. Long before sunset she was still in sight,
      drifting on a smooth sea to the westward; then she suddenly disappeared,
      and nothing was ever known of her fate, and of the awful ending of her
      hapless captain and crew, except what was known by the perpetrators of the
      massacre themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was Niâbon's story of <i>Te Mata Toto</i>, and both Lucia and myself
      were glad to get away from the immediate vicinity of the tragedy, and
      return to our camping place near the boat, where we found both Tematau and
      Tepi awaiting us with some fine mullet, which I supplemented later on by a
      few plover. In the afternoon, whilst the women slept, the two men and
      myself cleaned our firearms, and attended to various matters on the boat.
      At sunset the breeze came away freshly from the old quarter&mdash;the
      south-east&mdash;and by dark we were at sea again, heading due north for
      Makin, the most northerly of the Gilbert Group, which was eighty miles
      distant, and which island I wanted to sight before keeping away north-west
      for the Caroline Archipelago, for there was a long stretch between, and I
      was not too brilliant a navigator.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      However, we were not to see Makin Island, for about midnight the wind
      chopped round to the north&mdash;right ahead&mdash;and by daylight we had
      to reef down and keep away for the south point of Apaian, in the hope that
      by running along the east coast for a few miles we might get shelter. But
      we found it impossible to anchor owing to the heavy sea running; neither
      could we turn back and make for our former anchorage, which was now
      exposed to the full strength of the wind and sweep of the sea. We
      certainly could make the passage at the north end of Tarawa&mdash;near the
      Island of the Bloody Eye&mdash;and run into the lagoon, where we should be
      in smooth water; but we did not want to go back to Tarawa, under any
      circumstances&mdash;my own pride, quite apart from my companions'
      feelings, would not let me entertain that idea for an instant. To attempt
      to beat back round the south point of Apaian, and get into Apaian Lagoon
      would be madness, for the sea in the straits was now running mountains
      high, owing to a strong westerly current, and the wind was steadily
      increasing in violence; and even had it not been so, and we could have got
      inside easily, would either Lucia or myself have cared to avail ourselves
      of its security. For Bob Randall, the trader there, would be sure to board
      us, and Bob Randall, one of the straightest, decentest white men that ever
      trod in shoe leather, would wonder what Mrs. Krause was doing in Jim
      Sherry's boat! He and I had never met, but he knew both Krause and Mrs.
      Krause. No, I thought, that would never do.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time we were hugging the land as near as we could, first on one
      tack, then on the other, hoping that the weather would moderate, but
      hoping in vain, for the sky was now a dull leaden hue, and the sea was so
      bad, even in our somewhat sheltered situation, that we were all more or
      less sea-sick. I got my chart and studied the thing out. Sixty miles due
      south of us was Maiana Lagoon&mdash;a huge square-shaped atoll, into which
      we might run, and have the boat plundered by the natives to a certainty.
      That was no good. No, if the gale did not moderate, there was but one
      course open to me&mdash;to run before it for Apamama, a hundred and thirty
      miles to the S.S.E., which meant two hundred and sixty miles of sailing
      before we laid a course for the N.W. And then the delay. We might be tied
      up by the nose in Apamama Lagoon for a week or more before we could make
      another start. I rolled up the chart, wet and soddened as it was with the
      rain beating on it, and angrily told Tematau, who was steering, to watch
      the sea, for every now and then the boat would plunge heavily and ship a
      caskful or two of water over the bows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are in a bad place here, master,&rdquo; he replied, quietly; &ldquo;'tis the
      strong current that raiseth the high sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knew he was right, and could not but feel ashamed of my irritability,
      for both he and Tepi had been watching the boat most carefully, and I
      there and then decided what to do, my ill-temper vanishing when I saw Mrs.
      Krause and Niâbon bailing out the water which had come over the hatch
      coamings into their cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a bad start for us, Lucia,&rdquo; I said cheerfully; &ldquo;we can't dodge
      about here under the lee of the land with such a sea running. I am afraid
      that there is no help for us but to make a run for it for Apamama. What do
      you think, Niâbon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at me with a smiling face, and rising to her feet steadied
      herself by placing her hands on the after-coaming of the hatch. Her thin
      muslin gown was wet through from neck to hem, and clung closely to her
      body, and as her eyes met mine, I, for the first time in my life, felt a
      sudden tenderness for her, something that I never before felt when any
      woman's eyes had looked into mine. And I had never been a saint, though
      never a libertine; but between the two courses, I think, I had had as much
      experience of women as falls to most men, and I had never yet met a woman
      who seemed to so hold and possess my moral sense as did this semi-savage
      girl, who, for all I knew, might be no better than the usual run of
      Polynesian girls with European blood in their veins. But yet at that
      moment, I felt, ay, I <i>knew</i>, though I could not tell why, that she
      was <i>not</i> what she might well have been, when one considered her past
      environment, and her lonely unprotected situation&mdash;that is, lonely
      and unprotected from a civilised and conventional point of view; for with
      the wild races among whom she had dwelt since her infancy, she had always
      met with full, deep, and ample protection, and love and respect&mdash;and
      fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art the captain, Simi,&rdquo; she said in Samoan, &ldquo;and thou alone canst
      guide us on the sea. And I think, as thou dost, that we must sail before
      the storm to Apamama; for when the wind comes suddenly and strong from the
      north, as it has done now, it sometimes lasteth for five days, and the sea
      becomes very great.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis well, Niâbon,&rdquo; I answered, with a laugh, meant more for Lucia than
      for her; &ldquo;we shall turn the boat's head for Apamama, and lie there in the
      lagoon in peace till the gale hath died away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then we wore ship, and in another hour were racing before the gale
      under the jib and an extemporised foresail of a mat lashed to two short
      oars, the lower one fast to the deck, and the upper one, eighteen inches
      or so higher, to the mast stays. This lifted the boat beautifully, and
      made her steer ever so much easier than had I tried to run her with a
      close-reefed mainsail, for the lopping seas would have caught the boom,
      and either capsized us or carried the mast away, and yet I had to keep
      enough canvas on her&mdash;jib and mat foresail&mdash;to run away from the
      toppling mountains of water behind us. I had never had such an experience
      before, and hope I may never have one like it again. Every few minutes we
      would drop down into a valley as dark as death, with an awful wall of
      blackness astern, towering over us mountain high, shaking and wavering as
      if it knew not the exact spot whereunder we, struggling upward, lay
      helpless in the trough, awaiting to be sent to the bottom if we failed to
      rise on the first swelling outlier of the black terror astern.

    </div>
    <p>
      How we escaped broaching to and foundering in that wild gale will always
      be a wonder to me, for the boat, although she did not ship much water,
      seemed so deadly sluggish at times that looking astern made my flesh
      creep. All that night we went tearing along, and glad enough we were when
      day broke, and we saw the sun rise. The wind still blew with great
      violence, but later on in the morning the sky cleared rapidly, and at nine
      o'clock, to our delight, we sighted Apamama a little to leeward, distant
      about eight miles, and in another hour we raced through the north passage
      and brought-to in smooth water under the lee of two small uninhabited
      islands which gave us good shelter. From where we were anchored we could
      see the main village, which was six miles away to the eastward, and I
      quite expected to see visitors coming as soon as the wind fell
      sufficiently to permit of boats or canoes beating over to us, and
      determined to give them the slip if possible, and get under way again
      before they could board us and urge me to come and anchor on the other
      side, abreast of the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      My reasons for wishing to avoid coming in contact with the people were
      shared by my companions, and were based on good grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ruler of Apamama, King Apinoka, was, although quite a young man, the
      most powerful and most dreaded of all the chiefs of the islands of the
      mid-Pacific, and he boasted that in time he would crush out and utterly
      exterminate the inhabitants of the surrounding islands unless they
      submitted to him, and for years past had been steadily buying arms of the
      best quality. He had in his employ several white men, one of whom was his
      secretary, another was a sort of military instructor, and a third
      commanded a small but well-armed schooner, and it was his (the king's)
      ambition to possess a steamer, so that he could more easily and
      expeditiously set out on his career of conquest. The revenue he derived
      was a very large one, for the island contained hundreds of thousands of
      coco-nut trees, and all day long, from morn till night, his subjects were
      employed in turning the nuts into oil or copra, which he sold to trading
      vessels. A thorough savage, though he affected European dress at times, he
      ruled with a rod of iron, and he had committed an appalling number of
      murders, exercising his power and his love of bloodshed in a truly
      horrifying manner. For instance, if one of his slaves offended him, he
      would have the man brought before him and order him to climb a very tall
      coco-nut tree which grew in front of the king's house and throw himself
      down. If the poor wretch hesitated, Apinoka would then and there shoot him
      dead; if he obeyed, and threw himself down, he was equally as certain to
      be killed by the fall&mdash;sixty feet or more. Wherever he went he was
      surrounded by his bodyguard, and his haughty and domineering disposition
      was a general theme among the white traders of the Pacific Islands. To
      those captains who supplied him with firearms he was liberal to lavishness
      in the favours he conferred; to any who crossed him or declined to pander
      to him, he would be grossly insulting, and forbid them to ever come into
      the lagoon again.
    </p>
    <p>
      His house was a huge affair, and contained an extraordinary medley of
      articles&mdash;European furniture, sewing machines, barrel organs, brass
      cannon and cannon-balls, cuckoo clocks, bayonets, cutlasses, rifles, cases
      and casks of liquor, from Hollands gin to champagne, and fiery Fiji rum to
      the best old French brandy. His harem consisted of the daughters of his
      most notable chiefs, and occupied a house near by, which was guarded day
      and night by men armed with breechloaders, who had instructions to shoot
      any one who dared to even look at the king's favourites.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, strangely enough, the very people over whom this despot
      tyrannised were devotedly attached to him; and many trading captains had
      told me that he was &ldquo;a real good sort when you got to know him.&rdquo; One of
      these men a few years later conveyed Apinoka and five hundred of his
      fighting-men to the neighbouring islands of Euria and Axanuka&mdash;two of
      the loveliest gems of the mid-Pacific&mdash;and witnessed the slaughter of
      the entire male population, Apinoka sparing only the young women and the
      strongest children, keeping the former for himself and his chiefs, and the
      children for slaves. As might have been expected, there were always plenty
      of renegade and ruffianly white men eager to enter into his service, in
      which they could give full fling to their instincts of rapine and
      licentiousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had never seen Apinoka nor any of his European hangers-on, and had no
      desire to make his or their acquaintance, so I anxiously watched the
      weather and had everything ready to get under way the moment we could do
      so with safety. But though it was smooth enough inside the lagoon, the
      wind continued to blow with undiminished violence, and even had it
      moderated there was such a terrific sea tumbling in through the narrow
      passage, that it would have been a most risky undertaking to have
      attempted to beat out against a head wind, with such a heavy, sluggish
      boat. Had I known what was to happen I should have risked it ten times
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon, whilst we were having our midday meal, Tematau, who was standing
      for'ard, scanning the eastern shore of the atoll, said he could see a boat
      coming towards us, beating up under a reefed mainsail and jib.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is one of Apinoka's boats, Simi,&rdquo; said Niâbon, &ldquo;for there is no trader
      in Apamama; the king will let no one trade here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we can't help ourselves,&rdquo; I said, as I looked at the boat through
      my glasses; &ldquo;she is beating up for us&mdash;there is no doubt about that.
      I daresay we shall get rid of them when they find out who we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Niâbon shook her head, and by their faces I saw that both Tepi and Tematau
      did not like the idea of our awaiting the coming boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can we do?&rdquo; I said, with childish petulance. &ldquo;We cannot go to sea in
      such weather as this, and get knocked about uselessly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master,&rdquo; said big Tepi gravely, &ldquo;may I speak?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; I said, as I handed my glasses to Lucia&mdash;&ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This master. These men of Apamama be dangerous. No one can trust them;
      and they will be rude and force themselves upon us, and when they see the
      many guns we have on board they will take them by force, if thou wilt not
      sell them at their own price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them so try,&rdquo; I said, in sudden anger at the thought of a boatload of
      King Apinoka's crowd of naked bullies coming on board and compelling me to
      do as they wished: &ldquo;I will shoot the first man of them who tries to lay
      his hand on anything which is mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tepi's black eyes sparkled, and all the fighting blood of his race leapt
      to his cheeks and brow, as he stretched out his huge right arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, master. And I too desire to fight. But these men will come as
      friends, and their numbers and weight will render us helpless in this
      small boat. Is it not better that we should hoist the anchor and run
      before the wind to the south passage, gain the open sea, and then come to
      anchor again under the lee of the land until the storm is spent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His suggestion was so sensible that I felt annoyed and disgusted with
      myself. Of course there was a south passage less than ten miles distant,
      and we could easily run down to it and bring to outside the reef, and
      either lay-to or anchor in almost as smooth water as it was inside. But I
      would not let Lucia or Niâbon think that I had forgotten about it; so I
      spoke sharply to poor Tepi, and told him to mind his own business. Did he
      think, I asked, that I was a fool and did not know either of the south
      passage or my own mind? And so I let my vanity and obstinacy overrule my
      common sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get thy arms ready,&rdquo; I said to Tematau and Tepi, &ldquo;and if these fellows
      are saucy stand by me like men, I shall not lift anchor and ran away
      because Apinoka of Apamama sendeth a boat to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, I honestly believe that these two men thought that there would be
      serious trouble if I was so foolishly obstinate as to await the coming
      boat, when we could so easily lift anchor, rip down the lagoon, and be out
      through the south passage and in smooth water under the lee of the land in
      less than an hour; but at the same time they cocked their eyes so lovingly
      at the Sniders and Evans's magazine rifles which Niâbon passed up to me
      that I knew they were secretly delighted at the prospect of a fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Niâbon said something in a low voice to Lucia, who then spoke to me, and
      said nervously&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please do not think I am a coward, Mr. Sherry. But do you not think it is
      better for us to get away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't,&rdquo; I answered so rudely that her face flushed scarlet, and her
      eyes filled with tears; &ldquo;I shall stay here if fifty of King Apinoka's
      boats were in sight.&rdquo; And as I spoke I felt a strange, unreasoning fury
      against the approaching boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      I picked up an Evans rifle&mdash;we had two on board&mdash;filled the
      magazine, handed it to Niâbon, told her to lay it down in the little
      cabin, out of sight, with the other arms&mdash;three Snider carbines, my
      breechloading shotgun, and three of those rotten pin-fire French service
      revolvers&mdash;the Lefaucheux. My own revolver was a Deane and Adams, and
      could be depended upon&mdash;the Lefaucheux could not, for the cartridges
      were so old that twenty-five per cent, of them would miss fire. Years
      before, at a ship chandler's shop in Singapore, I had bought twenty of
      these revolvers, with ten thousand cartridges, for a trifling sum,
      intending to sell them to the natives of the Admiralty Islands, who have a
      great craze for &ldquo;little many-shooting guns,&rdquo; as they call repeaters; but
      the cartridges were so defective that I was ashamed to palm them off as an
      effective weapon, and had given all but three away to various traders as
      curiosities to hang upon the walls of their houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the boat drew near I saw that she was steered by a white man, who
      sailed her beautifully. He was dressed in a suit of dirty pyjamas, and
      presently, as the wind lifted the rim of the wide Panama hat he was
      wearing, I caught a glimpse of his features and recognised him&mdash;Florence
      Tully, one of the greatest blackguards in the Pacific, and whom I had last
      seen at Ponape, in the Carolines. As he saw me looking at him, he took off
      his hat and waved it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is 'Florry' Tully, Jim,&rdquo; said Lucia. &ldquo;I have often seen him. He is
      the man who shot his wife&mdash;a native girl&mdash;at Yap, in the
      Carolines, because she told the captain of a Spanish gunboat that he had
      been selling arms to the natives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the fellow too,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;the little scoundrel used to be
      boatswain of Bully Hayes's brig, the <i>Leonora</i>. Hayes kicked him
      ashore at Jakoits Harbour, on Ponape, for stealing a cask of rum from the
      <i>Leonora</i>, and selling it to the crew of an American whaler.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Five minutes later the boat, which was crowded with natives, went about
      like a top, and then Tully&mdash;as fine a sailor man as ever put hand to
      a rope&mdash;brought her alongside in such a manner that I could not but
      admire and envy the little blackguard's skill.
    </p>
    <p>

    </div>
    <p>
      The boat itself was kept in fine order, and was painted like all the
      king's miniature fleet&mdash;white outside, and bright salmon inside. One
      glance at his boat's crew showed me that they were all armed&mdash;in a
      flashy melodramatic style, like the Red Indians of a comic opera, each
      naked native having a brace of revolvers buckled to a broad leather belt
      around his waist, from which also hung a French navy cutlass in a leather
      sheath. They were all big, stalwart fellows, though no one of them was as
      tough a customer to deal with as our Tepi, who eyed them with undisguised
      enmity as he caught and made fast the line they heaved aboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Tully, red-headed, red-bearded, unwashed, and as dirty generally as
      a pig from his own County Down, jumped on board and extended his filthy
      paw to me effusively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, now, I jest am surprised to see you, Jim Sherry,&rdquo; he said with the
      &ldquo;Down East&rdquo; drawl he affected&mdash;he called himself an American&mdash;&ldquo;why,
      we haven't seen one another fer quite a stretch. Naow, tell me, where air
      you from and where air you goin'?&rdquo; &ldquo;From Tarawa, and bound to Taputeuea&rdquo;
       (an island a hundred miles to the south), I replied curtly, my temper
      rising, as suddenly catching sight of Lucia and Niâbon, he stared rudely
      at the former, then grinned and held out his hand to her. She touched it
      coldly with ill-disguised aversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you too, Mrs. Krause! Wal, this is surprisin'. And where are <i>you</i>
      goin'? Where's the boss?&rdquo; &ldquo;Mr. Krause is on Tarawa,&rdquo; she replied quickly,
      &ldquo;and he has chartered Mr. Sherry's boat to take me to Drummond's Island&rdquo;
       (Taputeuea), &ldquo;where there is a German barque loading for Samoa.&rdquo; The
      latter part of her remark was quite true, and Tully knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is so, the <i>Wandrahm</i>. She's been lying there nigh on four
      months. And so you goin' ter Samoa, eh? Wal, I wish I was goin' there
      myself; but I've got a rosy berth here&mdash;I'm boss of King Apinoka's
      fleet of trading boats, an' live like a fightin' cock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was about to ask him to have a glass of grog, just out of mere civility
      and island custom, when Tematau and Tepi made a sudden movement, and
      turning, I saw that they were trying to prevent three or four of Tolly's
      boat's crew from coming on board.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell your men to keep to their boat, please,&rdquo; I said sharply. &ldquo;My two men
      don't understand the ways of these Apamama people, and they'll be
      quarrelling presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, certainly, Jim,&rdquo; he said, with such oily effusiveness that I longed
      to kick him over the side; &ldquo;but there ain't no need for your men to be
      scared. My crew on'y want to hev' a bit of a gam{*} with yours&mdash;thet's
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Whalemen's parlance for gossip.
</pre>
    <p>
      He told his men to stay in the boat, but I saw him give them a swift
      glance, and prepared myself for the next move. Tepi was watching him
      keenly; Tematau went for'ard and began splitting kindling wood in a lazy,
      aimless sort of a way, but I knew that he, too, was ready. Still I felt
      that we were in a tight place&mdash;three men against ten, exclusive of
      Tully. However, I tried to appear at my ease, and asked him to have a
      drink. Niâbon passed us up a half-bottle of brandy, two tin mugs and some
      water.
    </p>
    <p>
      My visitor tossed off his liquor, and lit a cigar, offering me another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a fine lump of a boat,&rdquo; he said, running his eye over the deck,
      and then trying to peer into the little cabin; &ldquo;you wouldn't care about
      sellin' her, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;not now, at any rate. Must fulfil my charter first. But
      I am open to an offer when we come back from Drummond's Island. I suppose
      you want her for the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is so. He's keen on getting better and bigger boats than those he
      has, and will sling out the dollars for anything that takes his fancy&mdash;like
      this one will. Won't you run down with her now, and let him have a look at
      her? It'll be a lot better than lyin' up here, and the king wants to see
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I detected the suppressed eagerness in his voice as he made his request,
      and pretended to think for a few moments, blaming myself for my folly in
      not clearing out when we could have done so easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said slowly, as if I had considered the matter, &ldquo;I think we'll lay
      here for to-day anyway. But I don't see why I could not run down early
      to-morrow. Do you think the king could spare me about fifty fathoms of 1
      3/4 inch line? I want some badly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course&mdash;I'll give it to you myself. But I partickler want you to
      come back with me rightaway, ez Apinoka will jest be ragin' mad with me if
      I go back by myself. You see, he's going away to the south end of the
      lagoon at daylight on a fishin' trip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll run down to the town in the morning and wait till he returns,&rdquo;
       I said, inwardly boiling at the man's persistency. &ldquo;A day or two days'
      delay won't matter to me, and I think I'll put the boat up on the beach
      and get a look at her underneath&mdash;I think some of her seams want
      caulking. That will take one day at least, and then we might just as well
      be lying high and dry on the beach instead of being half-drowned outside,
      running before this northerly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little devil was disappointed&mdash;that could be seen by his face&mdash;and
      I was also pretty sure did not believe my talk about the rope I wanted and
      the caulking to be done. But I was now burning with anxiety to get rid of
      him and his boatload of naked bullies. Once they were well away from us, I
      would get up anchor and make sail for the south passage and get to sea
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, just as you please,&rdquo; he said sullenly, as he helped himself to
      another brandy. &ldquo;I suppose I must get back.&rdquo; Then he asked me if I had any
      rifles to sell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. We only have enough for ourselves. Oh, where's the water? Niâbon,
      some water please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He started and looked hard at the girl. &ldquo;Is that there gal the witch
      woman?&rdquo; he asked quickly, staring at her steadily. &ldquo;'Niâbon' you called
      her, didn't you? Where is she goin'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Mrs. Krause,&rdquo; I said shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Caesar's sea boots! Apinoka and his people know all about her.
      He'll be mighty glad to see her. She's denied good-lookin' too. Why, I
      thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He jumped to his feet and told his boat's crew that &ldquo;Niâbon&rdquo; was on board,
      and in an instant every one of them was staring at her and calling out her
      name, and one of them, bolder than the rest, made a gesture to her to get
      into the boat. I pretended not to notice it, and Niâbon herself told them
      that we were all very tired and wanted sleep, but that in the morning she
      would talk with them all at the village&mdash;when we came to see the
      king. They seemed satisfied, but a deal of whispering went on&mdash;and I
      felt certain that had Tully given them the word, they would have there and
      then rushed us and captured the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, I must be goin',&rdquo; said Tully at last; &ldquo;when do you think you'll be
      down? The king will be mighty vexed at not seein' you to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's only eight miles across,&rdquo; I said carelessly, &ldquo;so I daresay we'll be
      there about seven in the morning, before breakfast. But,&rdquo; I added, to
      allay his suspicions, &ldquo;the weather may take up a bit this afternoon; if it
      does, I'll come along rightaway, after we have had a sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said that the chances were that it would take up, as the wind was
      hauling more to the eastward, which meant rain, and once rain fell the
      wind would fall too.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had a third drink, and I passed a couple of bottles of square-face oyer
      to his crew, and then, to our intense satisfaction, Tally went over the
      side into his own boat, which at once pushed off, and in a few minutes was
      slipping over the lagoon towards the big village, Tolly waving his dirty
      Panama hat to us as he stood grasping the steer oar. I almost fancied I
      could see him grin evilly at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simi,&rdquo; said Niàbon as she watched the receding boat, &ldquo;let us get away
      from here quickly. That man Florry means ill to us, for I saw his eyes
      gleam when, as Lucia sat down on the mats under which the rifles are
      hidden, he heard them rattle together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tepi and Tematau joined her in her assertion that Tully meant mischief and
      would seize the boat for the king, who would have no compunction in
      resorting to violence or murder to achieve his object, especially with a
      man like Tully to cany out his wishes. Tepi also said that once the king
      knew that Niâbon was on board he would use every effort to gain possession
      of her. Then, too, the firearms we carried were a further incentive to
      treachery&mdash;the king's mania to increase his stock of arms and
      ammunition being well known.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; I said to Lucia, &ldquo;I'm quite as anxious as any one of us to
      get away. Let us wait, however, till Tully's boat is well down the
      lagoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master,&rdquo; said Tepi, &ldquo;do not delay. See, the wind is falling, and rain&mdash;much
      rain&mdash;is close to from the east, and the rain killeth the wind. And
      this is a heavy boat to move with oars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was quite right, for, as Tully had said was likely, the wind was not
      only falling, but was going round to the eastward. The sooner we got out
      of Apamama Lagoon the better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll loose the mainsail then,&rdquo; I said to Niâbon, &ldquo;and we'll get away.
      But we won't hoist it yet. We'll up anchor and drift until the rain comes&mdash;it
      will be on us in a quarter of an hour, and Tully won't be able to see
      anything of us till we are abreast of the passage; and we may get out to
      sea without any one seeing us at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We got the anchor up, and with mainsail and jib all ready for hoisting,
      let the boat drift, and in another quarter of an hour a dense rain squall
      came down on us from the eastward with just enough wind in it to send us
      along at a smart pace as soon as we hoisted our sails. In less than an
      hour we were pretty close to the passage; for, although we could not see
      it owing to the rain, we felt the force of the swift current running out,
      and could hear the subdued roar of the dangerous tide-rips. Tematau was
      for'ard, holding on to the fore-stay and peering ahead. Suddenly he gave a
      cry of alarm and shouted to me to luff.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was too late, for almost at the same time we struck with a crash, and
      the current, catching the boat's stern, slewed her round broadside on to
      the reef, where she lay hard and fast, though shaking in every timber as a
      wall of water, hissing like a boiling cauldron, formed against her
      starboard side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bidding the women sit quite quiet, we let go main and jib halliards and
      got the sails inboard&mdash;no easy task under the circumstances. The
      water was not very deep, less than three feet, and every moment was
      decreasing in depth as the tide rushed out. This was fortunate for us in
      one respect, for we could at least see what damage had been done when she
      struck and possibly make it good; but on the other hand we should have to
      stick where we were till the flood tide, and I was horribly afraid of the
      rain clearing off and revealing us to the natives.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, there was no use in meeting trouble halfway, so we waited
      patiently for half an hour, when the reef became bare and we could make an
      examination of the boat's bottom&mdash;on one side at least. It did not
      take us long to discover that no great harm had been done&mdash;she had
      struck fairly stem on to a patch of growing coral, which was better than
      hard rock&mdash;and beyond carrying away a bit of her false keel, and
      deeply scoring the bow planking, there was nothing else we could see at
      which to grumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was considering what was best to be done&mdash;the whole five of us
      could not even move so heavy a boat an inch&mdash;when to my disgust the
      rain suddenly cleared, and I saw that we were aground on Entrance Island,
      with a native village staring us in our faces less than a quarter of a
      mile away! And almost at the same moment we saw ten or a dozen men walking
      over the reef towards us. Through my glasses I saw that they were carrying
      nets and fish baskets, and I felt relieved at once; the moment they saw us
      they dropped their burdens and came on at a run. None of them were armed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are some of the king's fisherfolk,&rdquo; said Tepi, scanning them
      closely; &ldquo;that is their village, Only fishermen and two of the king's
      pilots live here. I have heard them spoken of many times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they are just the very fellows we want,&rdquo; I said to Lucia; &ldquo;there's
      enough of them, with us, to put the boat off this ledge into the water
      again. They'll be here in a few minutes. Niàbon, do you think we can be
      seen from the king's village? I can see the houses there quite plainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear so, Simi,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we must make these fellows who are coming to us work hard. I'll pay
      them well for it if they get us afloat again in another hour. Let me do
      all the talking. Take my glasses and let me know the moment you see a boat
      coming. We must not be caught here like this; and the tide won't turn for
      another hour at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were eleven natives, and when they were close to I noticed with
      satisfaction that most of them were sturdy, well-built fellows. They came
      up to us, and we all shook hands, and before even asking them to help me,
      I inquired if they would like some grog to dry their skins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia had a quart bottle of Hollands all ready, and in less than five
      minutes it was empty, and our visitors said I was a noble-minded and
      thoughtful man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;behold me and my friends&mdash;and this our boat cast
      upon the reef like a stranded porpoise. Wilt help us float again, so that
      we may get to the king's town to-night and sleep in peace? And I shall pay
      every man twenty sticks of rich, sweet tobacco and four bottles of grog
      between thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My munificent offer was received with acclamation, though at first they
      wanted a preliminary smoke and gossip, but I bade them hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No time have we for talk now, friends,&rdquo; I said, jocularly slapping one of
      them on his brawny shoulders; &ldquo;'tis but this morning the king sent a white
      man to me in his own boat to bid me welcome; and, as we hurried down the
      lagoon, that devil's rain sent me astray, so that the boat was caught in
      the current and swept down into the passage, where we struck, as thou
      seest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My explanation was quite satisfactory, and they went to work with a will,
      lightening the boat&mdash;after a first and fruitless attempt to move her&mdash;by
      taking out all our water, stores, &amp;c. We were but fifty or sixty feet
      away from the edge of the channel; and in half an hour, by our united
      effort, had dragged her half the distance, when Niâbon beckoned me to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two boats half-way down the lagoon,&rdquo; she said in a low voice:
      &ldquo;one is that of Tully, and they are using both sails and oars. See, they
      are plainly in sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I jumped back again amongst the natives. I knew that they would have
      already seen the coming boats had they not been toiling so hard, so I
      called to Niâbon to open another bottle of grog and serve it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurry, hurry, O strong men,&rdquo; I cried, as we moved the boat another foot
      astern, &ldquo;else shall I be laughed at by the king's white men, for two boats
      are coming. And instead of twenty it shall be forty sticks of tobacco each
      if ye get this boat in the water before the king's men are here to laugh
      at me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor beggars were working like Trojans, their naked bodies streaming
      with perspiration, as Niâbon held out to each of them half a pannikinful
      of raw gin, which was tossed off at one swallow. Then both she and Lucia,
      who was now on the reef, began digging the promised tobacco out of a case
      with sheath knives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't bother to count the sticks!&rdquo; I cried, as the boat made a sudden
      move and was kept going for nearly a dozen feet. &ldquo;Toss out about half of
      the case and be ready to jump on board and get under cover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last, with a yell of satisfaction from the natives, the stern post was
      seen to be over the ledge of the coral, and then with one final effort the
      boat went into the water with a splash like a sperm whale &ldquo;breaching.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, in with everything,&rdquo; I shouted to Tematau, as one glance showed me
      the two boats, now less than half a mile away, coming along at what seemed
      to me to be infernal speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tematau and the natives made a rush at the boxes of stores, bundles of
      sails, water breakers, and everything else, and tumbled them on board
      anyhow, Lucia and Niâbon taking the lighter articles from them and
      dropping them into the cabin, so as to give us more deck room, whilst I
      ran up the jib, and big Tepi the mainsail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take all the loose tobacco there, my friends,&rdquo; cried Niâbon to the
      fishermen, who with panting bosoms stood looking at us as if we had all
      gone mad, &ldquo;and here are the four bottles of <i>rom</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One of them sprang to the side of the boat just as I, feeling every moment
      that I should drop with exhaustion, pushed her off with an oar into deep
      water. And then we heard a chorus of yells and cries from the two boats,
      as we eased off the jib and main sheets, and Niâbon put her before the
      wind. Then <i>crack! crack!</i> and two bullets went through the mainsail
      just below the peak, and I heard Tolly's voice shouting to me to bring to
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come aft here, you two,&rdquo; I cried to Tepi and his mate; &ldquo;get out the guns,
      quick. Sit down in the cabin and fire, one on each side of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not speak a moment too soon, for the leading boat suddenly lowered
      her sail, took in all her oars but two, and began firing at us at less
      than three hundred yards, and every bullet hit us somewhere, either in the
      hull or aloft. Then they took to their oars again, and I saw that unless
      we could knock some of them over she&mdash;and those in the second boat as
      well&mdash;would be aboard of us in a few minutes, for there was now but
      little wind and the strength of the ebb tide was fast slackening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tematau and Tepi each fired two or three shots in quick succession, but
      missed, and then a very heavy bullet struck the side of the coaming of the
      steering-well in which I was seated, glanced off and ploughed along the
      deck, and the second boat now began firing into us with breechloading
      rifles of some sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me try,&rdquo; I said to Tematau, clambering out of the well into the
      cabin. &ldquo;Go and steer, but sit down on the bottom, or you'll be hit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Niâbon handed me my Evans' rifle in the very nick of time, for at that
      moment Tully stood up in the stern sheets of his boat and, giving the
      steer oar to a native, began to take pot shots at Tepi and myself. I
      waited until my hand was a bit steady, and then down he went headlong
      amongst his crew. I knew I could not possibly have missed him at such a
      short distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0018" id="linkimage-0018">

       alt="I Waited Until My Hand Was a Bit Steady 166 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried Niâbon exultingly, as both Tepi and myself fired together
      and three of the native paddlers who were sitting facing us, rolled over
      off their seats, either dead or badly wounded, for in an instant the
      utmost confusion prevailed, some of the crew evidently wanting to come on,
      and the others preventing them. By this time the first boat was within
      easy pistol range the other, which was much larger and crowded with
      natives, being about forty yards astern of her, but coming along as hard
      as she could, two of her crew in the bows firing at us with a disgusting
      kind of a foreign army rifle, whose conical bullets were half as big as
      pigeon's eggs, and made a deuce of a noise, either when they hit the <i>Lucia</i>,
      or went by with a sort of a groanlike hum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take this,&rdquo; I said to Niâbon, giving her my Deane and Adams pistol, &ldquo;and
      do you and Tepi keep off those in the nearest boat if they come on again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she waved it aside, and seizing Tematau's carbine, stood up and sent
      her first shot crashing through the timbers of the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick, Tematau,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;get another rifle and fire with me at the
      second boat. Let ours come to the wind&mdash;it matters not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Picking out one of the two fellows who were shooting so steadily at us
      from the bows of their boat, I fired and missed, but another shot did for
      him, for he fell backwards and I saw his rifle fly up in the air and then
      drop overboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was enough for them, for the steersman at once began to slew her
      round, and then he too went down as a bullet from Tematau took him fair
      and square in the chest, and we saw the blood pouring from him as he fell
      across the gunwale. In another ten seconds they were paddling away from
      us, leaving the other boat to her fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is enough,&rdquo; I cried to Tepi, who I now noticed for the first time
      was bleeding from a bullet wound in the left arm, which had been hurriedly
      tied up by Lucia, &ldquo;that is enough. Put down your gun. There is now no one
      in the second boat shooting at us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are lying down in the bottom,&rdquo; said Niâbon, &ldquo;we can see them moving,
      but some have dived overboard, and swum ashore. See, there are four of
      them running along the reef.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them go, Niâbon,&rdquo; and then I turned to Lucia. She was deathly pale,
      but had all her wits about her, for although she could barely speak from
      excitement, she had some brandy and water ready for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; I said, as I poured a stiff dose into the pannikin, and
      taking first pull, passed it on to Tepi and the other man. &ldquo;Now we must
      have a look at that boat. We can't leave wounded men to drown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wind was now very light, but the boat was so near that we were soon
      alongside and looking into her. There were three dead, two badly wounded,
      one slightly wounded man, and one unhurt man in her. The latter looked at
      us without the slightest fear, even when Tepi, picking up a carbine,
      thrust the muzzle of it almost into his face. Niâbon gently took the
      weapon from Tepi's hand, laid it down and waited for me to question our
      prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the white man dead?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, he died but now. The bullet went in at where the ribs join.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To make sure that Tally was really dead I got down into the boat. He was
      lying on his face and was dead enough, though he had evidently lived until
      a few minutes previously.
    </p>
    <p>
      I jumped on board the <i>Lucia</i> again, and looked anxiously around.
      There was still a light air, but the tide was now setting in, and I did
      not want our boat to be carried back into the lagoon again. Then I turned
      to the prisoner, and asked him if he could tell me why he ought not to be
      shot. He made a gesture of utter indifference, and said he didn't care.
      Did I think he was a coward, he asked? Could he not have swum ashore? The
      king would kill him to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitying the poor wretch, I gave him a pipe, tobacco, and matches, and told
      him to help my men put the dead and wounded men on the reef, as I wanted
      the boat. The people at the fishing village, who had been watching the
      fight throughout from a safe distance, were within sight, so telling the
      prisoner he must go to them and get them to carry their dead and wounded
      up to the houses before the tide covered the reef again, I sent him off
      with Tematau, Tepi, and Niâbon. Their gruesome task was soon done, and the
      boat rid of her ensanguined cargo; then as soon as she came alongside
      again, I called Niâbon on board, and telling her to steer, went into the
      smaller boat and took the <i>Lucia</i> in tow.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we slowly crept out through the passage, we saw the fisher folk come
      down to the reef, and, lifting up the three dead men, carry them away,
      others following with the wounded. It was not a pleasant sight to see, nor
      even to think of, now that it was all over, and so we none of us spoke as
      we tugged at the oars.
    </p>
    <p>
      We got outside at last, and then ceased towing, as a light air carried us
      well clear of the outer reef. Coming alongside, we stepped on board, after
      having pulled out the boat's plug. Then we watched her drift astern to
      fill.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dawn when I was awakened, after a good four hours' sleep, Apamama was
      thirty miles astern of us, and we were running free before a nice cool
      breeze, steering N.W. for Kusaie Island, the eastern outlier of the
      Carolines, eight hundred miles away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two women had not heard me move, and were both sound asleep, their
      faces close together and their arms intertwined.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      We were thirteen long weary days between Apamama Lagoon and Kusaie, whose
      misty blue outline we hailed with delight when we first sighted it early
      one afternoon, forty miles away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calms and light winds had delayed us greatly, for as we crawled further
      northward, we were reaching the limit of the south-east trades, which, at
      that time of the year, were very fickle and shifty. Not a single sail of
      any description had we seen, though we kept a keen lookout night and day;
      for, after being ten days out from Apamama, I began to feel anxious about
      our position and would have liked to have spoken a ship, fearing that the
      current, in such calm weather, would set us so far to the westward that I
      should have difficulty in making the island if we once got to leeward of
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day after day had passed with the same unvarying monotony&mdash;light
      winds, a calm, then a brisker spell of the dying trades for a few hours,
      or a day at most&mdash;then another calm lasting through the night, and so
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      But our spirits very seldom flagged, and we contrived to make the time
      pass somehow. Lucia, whose face and hands were now browning deeply from
      continuous exposure to the rays of a torrid sun worked with Niâbon at
      dressmaking, for she had brought with her half a dozen bolts of print;
      and, as they sewed, they would sometimes sing together, whilst I and my
      two trusty men busied ourselves about the boat&mdash;scrubbing, scraping
      and polishing inside and out, cleaning and oiling our arms; or, when a
      shoal of bonita came alongside, getting out our lines and catching as many
      of the blue and marbled beauties as would last us for a day or two. But
      our chief relaxation, in which the two young women always joined us, was
      two or three hours of &ldquo;sailors' pleasure&rdquo; i.e., overhauling all our joint
      possessions, clothing, trade goods of all sorts, and carefully restowing
      them in the boxes in which they were packed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tepi's wound by this time was quite healed&mdash;the bullet had gone clean
      through the fleshy part of his arm, and then struck an oar which was
      lashed to the rail. He had got a nail from me and drove it through the
      lead into the wood&mdash;to be preserved as a memento of the fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of the day on which we sighted the blue peaks of beautiful
      Kusaie, the sky began to look ugly to the eastward, and at daylight it was
      blowing so hard, with such a dangerous sea, that I decided not to attempt
      to enter the weather harbour&mdash;Port Lelé&mdash;though that had been my
      intention, but to run round to the lee side to Coquille Harbour, where we
      could renew our fresh provisions, spell a day or two, and be among
      friends, for I knew the people of Kusaie pretty well.
    </p>
    <p>
      We got into the smooth water of Coquille just in time, for no sooner had
      we dropped anchor at the mouth of a small creek which debouched into the
      harbour through a number of mangrove islets, than it commenced to blow in
      real earnest, and terrific rain squalls drenched us through and made us
      shiver with cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The natives, however, had seen us, and presently, as soon as the rain
      ceased, three canoes appeared, each manned by five men. They welcomed us
      very heartily and urged us to come to the village&mdash;which was less
      than a quarter of a mile away. We were only too delighted to get ashore
      again after thirteen days' confinement on our little craft, so hurriedly
      packing a couple of boxes with dry clothing, and some articles for
      presents for the people, we put on the cabin hatches, made everything else
      snug on board, and half an hour later were all in the chiefs house, warm
      and dry, and telling him and his family as much about ourselves as we
      thought advisable.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as it could be cooked, they brought us an ample meal of hot baked
      fowls, pigeons, and fish, with a great quantity of vegetables&mdash;taro,
      yams, breadfruit, and sweet potatoes. The very smell of it, Tepi whispered
      to me, made his teeth clash together!
    </p>
    <p>
      We remained with these hospitable people for four days. There was nothing
      that they would not do for us&mdash;no trouble was too groat, no labour
      was aught but a pleasure to them. They brought the <i>Lucia</i> round to a
      small sandy beach near the village, discharged her, carried everything up
      to the houses, and cleaned her thoroughly inside and out, and then put her
      in the water again for us. When we bid them farewell and sailed, the
      boat's deck was covered with baskets of freshly-cooked food and a
      profusion of fruit, and Lucia and Niâbon were accompanied on board by
      every woman and girl in the place, some of whom wept unrestrainedly, and
      begged them not to venture their lives in such a small boat, but to remain
      on the island till a ship touched there, bound to the islands of the
      further north-west.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before finally parting with our kind friends I gave them twenty pounds of
      tobacco, which, though we had still four hundredweight left, was still our
      most valuable trade article, and would have to be disbursed carefully in
      future, and Lucia gave the chief's daughter a very handsome gold ring of
      Indian manufacture, though at first the girl declined accepting so
      valuable a present.

    </div>
    <p>
      We lost sight of Kusaie within ten hours, for we had a slashing breeze,
      which carried us along in great style, and all that night we sat up, none
      of us caring to sleep, for there was a glorious silver moon in a sky of
      spotless blue, and the sea itself was as a floor of diamonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Niâbon and Lucia, I must mention, had insisted on standing watch ever
      since we had left Apamama, and they certainly helped us a lot, for both
      could now steer very well, and took pleasure in it. The former, with Tepi,
      was in my watch, the latter was with Tematau, who, like all Eastern
      Polynesians, was a good sailor-man and could always be relied upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had now sailed over a thousand miles; and every day&mdash;every hour I
      gained more confidence in myself, and the resolution to make one of the
      greatest boat voyages across the Pacific had been ever strengthening in my
      mind since the day I looked at Chart No. 780 in Krause's house at Taritai.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could I not do with such a boat and two such men as Tepi and Tematau,
      after we had landed Lucia and Niâbon at Guam in the for north! We would
      refit the boat, and then turn our faces south once more, and sail back
      through the Western Carolines on to wild New Guinea&mdash;Dutch New
      Guinea, and run along the coast till we came to one of the few scattered
      Dutch settlements on the shores of that <i>terra incognita</i>. Tepi and
      Tematau would stick to me&mdash;they had sworn to do so&mdash;had told me
      so in whispers one bright night, as we three kept watch together and Lucia
      and Niâbon slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      Niâbon! What a strange strange girl she was! I should find it hard to say
      goodbye to her, I thought; and then I felt my cheeks flush.
    </p>
    <p>
      Say goodbye to her&mdash;part from her! Why should we part? Was I so much
      her superior that I need be ashamed of asking her to be my wife? What was
      I, anyway, but a broken man&mdash;a man whose father, my sole remaining
      relative, had nearly twenty years before told me with savage contempt that
      I had neither brains, energy, nor courage enough to make my way in the
      world, thrown me a cheque for a hundred pounds, and sneeringly told me to
      get it cashed at once, else he might repent of having given it to me to
      squander among the loose people with whom I so constantly associated. And
      I had never seen or heard from him, and never would. But I had that cheque
      still, for there always was in me a latent affection for the cold-faced,
      unsympathetic man who had broken my mother's heart, not by open
      unkindness, but by what the head gardener whisperingly told me (when she
      was lying dead, and I, sent for from college to attend the funeral, went
      to his cottage to see him) was &ldquo;silent, inwisible neglect, Master James;
      silent, inwisible neglect. That's wot killed her.&rdquo; For the servants loved
      my poor mother&mdash;their opinion of my father they discreetly kept to
      themselves. So I had kept the cheque, for burning with resentment against
      him as I was at the time, I remembered the words of my mother's last
      letter to me, written with her dying hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try hard to please him, James. He is very cold and stern, but I am sure
      that, deep down in his heart, he loves you well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That letter, with the cheque inside it, was now yellowed, and the writing
      faint, but I had kept them both. I would write to him some day, I had
      thought, and send him back the cheque, and my mother's letter as well, and
      then perhaps the hard old man would forgive me, and write and say &ldquo;Come.&rdquo;
       But the years went by, and I never wrote, and now it was too late, after
      fifteen had passed. Very likely he was dead, and had willed his money to
      churches or hospitals, or some such charities, and I should always be &ldquo;Jim
      Sherry, the trader,&rdquo; to the end of my days, and never &ldquo;James Shervinton,
      Esq., of Moya Woods, Donegal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, after all, what did it matter? I thought, as I held on to the
      forestay, and looked at the now paling moon sinking low down on our lee,
      as the glow of the coming sun tipped a bank of cloud to windward, with a
      narrow wavering ribbon of shining gold. I had nothing at which to grumble.
      My fifteen years of wandering had done me good, although I had not saved
      money&mdash;money, that in my father's eyes brought, before eternal
      salvation in the next world, primarily the beatitudes of some county
      eminence in Ireland and British respectability generally in this. Unless
      my father was still alive, and I could know he wanted to see me before he
      died, I should never go home&mdash;not after fifteen years of South Sea
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why should I not accept what Fate meant for me, and my own inclinations
      told me that I was destined for? I was intended to be &ldquo;Jim Sherry, the
      trader,&rdquo;&mdash;and I should ask &ldquo;Niâbon, of Danger Island,&rdquo; to be &ldquo;Jim
      Sherry's&rdquo; wife. Why not. I had never cared for any woman before except in
      a fleeting, and yet degrading manner&mdash;in a way which had left no
      memories with me that I could look back upon with tender regrets. She and
      I together might do great things in the South Seas, and found a colony of
      our own. She had white blood in her veins&mdash;of that I felt certain&mdash;and
      where Ben Boyd, of the old colonial days, failed to achieve, I, with a
      woman like Niâbon for my wife, could succeed. Ben Boyd was a dreamer, a
      man of wealth and of flocks and herds, in the newly-founded convict
      settlement of New South Wales, and his dream was the founding of a new
      state in the Solomon Islands, where he, an autocratic, but beneficent
      ruler, would reign supreme, and the English Government recognise him as a
      Clive, a Warren Hastings of the Southern Seas. But the clubs of the
      murderous Solomon Islanders&mdash;the country of the people in which he
      had already planned out vast achievements on paper&mdash;battered out his
      brains almost under the guns of his beautiful armed yacht, the <i>Wanderer</i>;
      and the name of Ben Boyd was now alone remembered by a decayed village and
      a ruined lighthouse on the south headland of Twofold Bay, in New South
      Wales, where, in the days of his prosperity, he had erected it, as a guide
      to the numerous American and English whaleships, which in those times
      traversed the Pacific from one end to the other, and would, he imagined,
      eagerly avail themselves of the quiet, landlocked harbour to repair and
      recruit, and sell their cargoes of sperm oil. But they never came, and his
      dream was ended ere his life was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I would ask her, as soon as I had an opportunity of speaking to her
      alone. It was true that she had once told me that she would never part
      from Lucia&mdash;and Lucia had often spoken to me of their plans for the
      future.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, my vanity whispered, she would listen to me She cared for me, I was
      sure, and would not long hesitate. We were certain to meet with at least
      one missionary going through the Carolines, and he would many us. If we
      did not, it would not matter&mdash;there were half a dozen Spanish priests
      in Guam. Then after our marriage I would go on in the boat to Amboyna,
      where I had a business friend, a rich trader&mdash;a man who liked and
      trusted me, and who would give me a thousand, ay, two thousand pounds'
      worth of trade goods for my pencilled I.O.U. in his notebook. Then I would
      buy a little schooner, and sail with Niâbon to the islands of the
      south-eastern Pacific, and begin trading. I would make Rapa, in the
      Austral Group, my head station, or else Manga Reva in the southern
      Paumotus&mdash;Niâbon should decide.
    </p>
    <p>
      The low cloud to windward lifted, the red sun leapt from the sea-rim, and
      then I felt a soft hand on my arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you thinking of, Jim? I called you twice, but you did not hear.
      I believe you were talking to yourself, for I twice saw you throw out your
      arm as if you were speaking to some one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I was, Lucia,&rdquo; I replied with a laugh. &ldquo;I was day-dreaming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Jim,&rdquo; she said softly, so softly that her voice sank to a
      whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now, Lucia. Wait till we get to the next land.&rdquo; And then in all
      innocence I added, as I looked at her, &ldquo;How bright and happy you look,
      Lucia! I think you grow more beautiful every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lifted her eyes to mine for one instant, and I saw in them a light I
      had never seen before.

      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Te fanua, te fanua! te fanua umi, umi lava!</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;Land, land! a long,
      long land!&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      As we, the &ldquo;watch below&rdquo;&mdash;Niâbon, Tepi, and myself&mdash;heard
      Tematau's loud cry, we sat up, and saw a long, dark line pencilled on the
      horizon right ahead, which we knew was the great lonely atoll named
      Providence Island on the charts, and called Ujilon by the natives of the
      North-Western Pacific.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was daylight of the sixth day out from Kusaie, and as I stood up to get
      a better view of the land I was well satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have done well,&rdquo; I said exultantly to Lucia, who was steering: &ldquo;three
      hundred and forty miles in five days&mdash;with a two-knot current against
      us all the way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0020" id="linkimage-0020">

    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">
      <img src="images/182.jpg" alt="Saw a Barque Lying on the Reef 182 "   width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      I did not know my way into Ujilon Lagoon, for I had never been there
      before, so I now had some trouble in picking up one of the two passages on
      the south side of the great atoll. At seven o'clock, just as we were
      entering it, we saw a barque lying on the reef about half a mile away to
      the northward. She was a good lump of a vessel&mdash;apparently of about
      seven or eight hundred tons, and the remnants of some of her upper canvas
      still fluttered to the breeze. We could discern no sign of life about her,
      nor were any boats visible; but we had no time to examine her just then,
      so sailed on across the lagoon, and, instead of dropping anchor, ran
      gently on to the beach of a densely wooded island, for the water was not
      only as smooth as glass, but very deep, the &ldquo;fall&rdquo; from the edge of the
      beach being very steep.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an hour we had lightened the boat sufficiently to float her along a
      narrow waterway, which wound a sinuous course through the solid coral rock
      into a little basin or natural dock, where we could board her at either
      low or high water, without wetting our feet, though she had a clear fathom
      of water under her keel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lagoon seemed alive with large and small fish&mdash;none of which,
      Niâbon said, were poisonous, like two thirds of those of the Marshall
      Island atolls, and the beaches and sand-flats were covered with small
      golden-winged plover, who displayed not the slightest fear of our
      presence, letting us approach them within a few yards, then rising and
      settling down again. From where we were we could see but seven of the
      chain of fifteen islands which comprised the atoll; all of these were
      thickly covered with coco palms, bearing an enormous crop of nuts, and
      here and there groves of jack-fruit and pandanus broke the monotonous
      beauty of the palms by their diversity of foliage.
    </p>
    <p>
      No traces of natives were visible, though I knew that there were a few&mdash;about
      thirty all told&mdash;for the redoubtable Captain Bully Hayes, who claimed
      Ujilon as his own, and whose brig was the first ship to enter the lagoon,
      had I knew established friendly intercourse with them. Two years before, I
      had met the famous captain at Anchorite's Islands&mdash;to the north of
      the Admiralty Group&mdash;when he had given me a description of Ujilon and
      its marvellous fertility, and had tried to induce me to go there with him
      with a gang of natives, and make oil for him. But although he made me a
      most liberal offer&mdash;he was a most delightful man to talk to, was the
      &ldquo;South Sea pirate&rdquo;&mdash;I did not trust him well enough, despite his
      merry, laughing blue eyes, jovial voice and handsome face, for he was a
      man who could be all things to all men; and the blue eyes sometimes went
      black, and the smooth, shapely hand that was for ever stroking the long
      flowing beard, liked too well to feel a trigger in the crook of its
      forefinger. So I laughingly declined his offer&mdash;even when, as an
      extra inducement, he pointed out to me a very handsome young Marshall
      Island girl, who would do the station honours for me at Ujilon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Mr. Sherry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;please yourself;&rdquo; and then over another
      bottle of wine, he gave me some further particulars about the great atoll,
      and told me of how it had taken him two months to get into communication
      with the few inhabitants; and of the particular island on which their
      village was concealed amid a dense grove of pandanus palms. But that was
      two years ago, and I had forgotten much that he had told me. However, as I
      intended to remain at Ujilon for two or three days, it was likely that we
      might come across them&mdash;they were very quiet and inoffensive people,
      so there was no danger to be apprehended from a meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      By noon we had our temporary camp made comfortable, and were having dinner
      when five natives made their appearance&mdash;three men and two women&mdash;coming
      towards us in a canoe. They landed without the slightest hesitation, and
      sat down with us; but we found that they spoke the Marshall Island
      dialect, which none of us but Niâbon could speak, and she but slightly.
      However, we managed to worry along, and to our surprise learned that Hayes
      had been at the island in his famous brig, the <i>Leonora</i>, only a
      month before, and that for a year and six months previously, seventy Line
      Island natives had been working on the islands under the supervision of a
      white man, making oil for the captain, but most of them, and the white man
      as well, had left the atoll in the brig, for Hayes had been so well
      pleased with the result of their work that he invited forty of the seventy
      to come on board and go with him to Ponapé, in the Carolines, for a
      month's recreation and &ldquo;feasting&rdquo; on that beautiful island.
    </p>

      <img src="images/188.jpg" alt="He Had Sailed 188 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      So with forty of his sturdy Line Islanders, and seven hundred barrels of
      coco-nut oil, he had sailed; and now, said our five friends, he would soon
      be back&mdash;perhaps in two days&mdash;perhaps in ten, or twenty, or
      more, for how could one tell what the winds would be? He was a good man,
      was the captain, but hot and sudden in his anger, over-fond of women who
      were good to look at, and cruel to those who sought to cross his desire;
      but generous&mdash;always generous&mdash;and kind to those who were weak
      and ill, giving them good medicine and rich food; tins of the red rich
      fish called <i>samani</i> which came from his own country, and biscuit and
      bread such as white men eat. Ah, he was a good man was &ldquo;Puli Ese&rdquo; (Bully
      Hayes).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask them about the wretched ship on the reef,&rdquo; I said to Niâbon,
      repeating the first question I had tried to put to them, but which they
      did not answer, so eager were they to tell us about Captain Hayes and
      themselves; &ldquo;ask them all about her&mdash;when did she run ashore, and
      where are the crew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah, the ship, the great ship! they replied. She had run up on the reef one
      night four moons ago, when the sky was bright and clear, and the wind blew
      strongly; and when in the morning they discerned her from the village, the
      white man had two boats manned to go to her assistance, but as the boats
      approached, two cannons fired heavy balls at them from the deck of the
      ship; and although the white man (Hayes's trader) tied his handkerchief to
      an oar and held it upright, the people on the ship continued to fire on
      the boats with the big cannons, and with muskets, and then, when one man
      was hit by a bullet and died quickly, the white man cursed those on the
      ship for fools, and turned the boats shoreward again, saying that those on
      board could perish before he would try to help them again. By sunset three
      boats, filled with men, had left the ship and sailed to the south. In the
      morning the white man (whom I knew from their description of him to be a
      well-known and decent South Sea trader named Harry Gardiner) boarded the
      ship and began to remove all that was of value on shore. Her hold was
      filled with all sorts of goods in barrels and cases, and when &ldquo;Puli Ese&rdquo;
       came, three months later, he was well pleased, not only for the seven
      hundred barrels of oil, but with the many things that had been gotten from
      the wrecked ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      We promised our new friends to come up to their village&mdash;where they
      and about twenty of their fellow islanders lived with the remainder of
      Bully Hayes's Line Island contingent&mdash;on the following day, and sent
      them away with a few trifling presents. As they said they could walk back,
      and I wanted to have a look at the wreck, they cheerfully agreed to let
      their canoe remain with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      About four in the afternoon, as the heat of the sun began to relax, I
      determined to set out in the canoe. Tematau and Tepi had gone across to
      the weather side of the island with my gun to shoot plover and frigate
      birds, of which latter, so the natives had told us, there were great
      numbers to be found on the high trees to windward. Lucia and Niâbon were
      resting in the shade, but the latter, when she saw me pushing the canoe
      into the water, asked me to let her come also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course; and you too, Lucia. Won't you come as well?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Jim. I feel very lazy, and I'm always so afraid of canoes,&rdquo; she said
      with a smile, &ldquo;and do be careful and not be capsized; look at all those
      horrid sharks swimming about&mdash;I can see nearly twenty of them from
      where I am sitting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both Niâbon and I laughed at her fears&mdash;the sharks were not
      man-eaters, as we knew by their black-tipped fins, though the species were
      dangerous when bad weather made the fish on which they preyed scarce; then
      they became vicious and daring enough, and would at times actually tear
      the oars out of the hands of a boat's crew. However, Lucia would not come,
      saying she would await the return of the men and pluck the plover which
      they were sure to bring back with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Lucia,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;we'll leave you to yourself. I <i>must</i>
      have a look at the barque, and find out her name. Wrecks have always had
      an attraction for me; and, besides that, I want to get a sheet or two of
      copper to nail over our stem, which was badly hurt when we ran ashore in
      Apamama Lagoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In another minute or two Niabon and I started, she sitting for'ard and I
      aft. The wind had died away, and the surface of the lagoon was as smooth
      as glass, and, through the crystal-clear water, we could discern the
      glories of the gorgeously-hued coral forest below. Is there such another
      sight in all the world as is revealed when you look down upon the bottom
      of a South Sea atoll.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Ah, no, there cannot be! And here as I write, there is before me the cold
      German Ocean, heaving and tumbling; grey, grim, and sullen under a dulled
      and leaden sky, and snowflakes beat and beat incessantly upon the opened
      windows of my room. Out upon the moor there is a flock of snow-white
      seagulls, driven to land by the wild weather, and as I gaze at them,
      fluttering to and fro, their presence seems to creep into my heart, and
      their wild, piping notes to say, &ldquo;You will go back, you will go back, and
      see some of us again; not here, under cold skies, but where the bright sun
      for ever shines upon a sea of deepest blue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      For half an hour or more we paddled in silence over the smooth waters of
      that sweet lagoon, the bow of the canoe kept steadily on towards the
      wrecked barque; and as I looked at the graceful figure of my companion,
      with her dark, glossy hair flowing over her back and swaying to and fro
      with every stroke, and saw the graceful poise of her head, and the
      backward sweep of her two little hands as she plunged her paddle into the
      water, and withdrew it swiftly and noiselessly, I felt that I could not, I
      must not delay in asking her to be my wife. Not that her physical beauty
      had so wrought upon my feelings&mdash;I was above that, I thank God, and a
      level brain&mdash;but because I felt that I loved her, ay, honestly <i>loved</i>
      her, and that she was a good and true woman, and our union would be a
      happy one.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took us much longer than we anticipated in coming up to the stranded
      ship, or rather to the inside edge of the reef on which she lay, high and
      dry, half a mile further to seaward. Taking my hammer and a blunt chisel&mdash;to
      prize off a sheet of copper&mdash;we made the canoe fast to a coral
      boulder, and set off across the reef, which gave forth a strong but sickly
      odour caused by the heat of the sun acting on the many-coloured and
      many-shaped marine organisms and living coral.
    </p>
    <p>
      Niâbon, whose feet were protected by strong <i>takka</i> (sandals woven of
      coco-nut fibre), stepped lightly and swiftly on before me; I with my heavy
      boots crushing into the brittle, delicate, and sponge-like coral,
      startling from their sunbaths hundreds of black and orange-banded
      sea-snakes&mdash;reptiles whose bite is as deadly as that of a
      rattlesnake, but which hastened out of our way almost as soon as they
      heard our footsteps. Here and there we had to turn aside to avoid deep
      pools, some of which, though not more than ten fathoms in width, were as
      blue as the ocean beyond, their rocky walls starting sheer up from their
      bases to the crust of the reef.
    </p>

    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">
      <img src="images/194.jpg" alt="At Last We Reached the Ship 194 "   width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      At last we reached the ship, and stood under her bowsprit. She was
      standing almost upright, wedged in tightly between three huge boulders,
      one on her port, and two on her starboard side, and I saw that she had
      struck with great violence, for just abreast of her foremast there was a
      jagged hole through which we could see into her lower hold. The natives
      had told us that there had been an unusually high tide when she ran
      ashore, and had it not been for her bringing up against the boulders, she
      might have torn her way over the reef into the lagoon, as she was under a
      strong press of sail, and the sea was smooth, and the stars shining
      brightly. Most of her copper had been stripped off by Hayes, but later on
      I found all I wanted by crawling under the bilge, and prizing off a few
      undamaged sheets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us find out her name before we go on board,&rdquo; I said to my companion.
      &ldquo;She's a foreigner, I'm sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Walking round to her stern we looked up and saw her name, <i>Agostino
      Rombo, Livorno</i>, painted in white letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I thought she was a foreigner, Niabon. I fancy we shall find a strong
      smell of garlic as soon as we get on deck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turning up along the port side, we soon found an easy way of getting on
      board, for just abreast of the mainmast Hayes's Chinese carpenters had cut
      down the main deck from the water-ways to the bilge, so as to give free
      access to the upper and lower holds.
    </p>
    <p>
      We first examined the lower hold, which contained about two hundred tons
      of New Caledonian nickel ore, and which, valuable as it was, Hayes had not
      troubled about removing. In the 'tween deck there was nothing to show of
      what the main portion of her cargo had consisted&mdash;everything had been
      removed, and only great piles of dunnage remained, and I came to the
      conclusion that the <i>Agostino Rombo</i> of Leghorn had been bound from
      some Australian port to China with a general cargo, when her incapable
      skipper ran her ashore&mdash;to Bully Hayes's satisfaction and benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ascending from the dark and silent 'tween decks, where our footsteps and
      voices echoed and re-echoed as though we were walking and speaking in some
      mountain cavern, we ascended to the main deck into the fresh, sweet
      daylight, though the sun was now low down on the western sky, and the
      first thing that attracted our attention was a lengthy notice on the
      mainmast, carefully and neatly painted on a sheet of copper. And as I read
      it, I could but laugh at Captain Hayes's natural American business
      instincts, combined with his usual humorous mendacity&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Notice to Wrecking Parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, William Henry Hayes, master and owner of the brig <i>Leonora</i>, of
      Shanghai, hereby notify all and sundry that the barque <i>Agostino Rombo</i>,
      of Leghorn, as she now lies on this reef, has been purchased by me from
      Captain Pasquale Lucchesi, and any person attempting to remove any of her
      deck-houses, spars, anchors, or cables, or certain nickel ore in the lower
      hold, are liable to be indicted for piracy. But all anchors, cables, and
      ground tackle generally may be removed on payment of 250 dols. to my
      native agent on this island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the main deck we ascended to the poop, and went below into the now
      darkening cabin, which we found was gutted of everything of value, except
      the captain's and officers' bedding, which had been tossed aside by Hayes
      and his crew, and which even the natives of Ujilon had regarded as too
      worthless to take away, though many a poor sailor man, shivering in
      northern seas, would have clutched at them as eagerly as a Jew pawnbroker
      would clutch at a necklace of pearls or a diamond-set tiara. The panelling
      of the main cabin was painted in white and gold, and presented a very
      handsome appearance, and on the door of every stateroom was an exceedingly
      well-painted picture of some saint renowned in history&mdash;evidently the
      owners of the <i>Agostino Rombo</i> were of pious minds. Underneath one of
      these pictures, that of St. Margaret of Hungary, was scribbled in pencil,
      &ldquo;Maggie is my fancy. Frank Hussey, mate brig <i>Leonora</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I scratched out the ribald words with my knife, and then we went up
      through the companion to the poop, and looked along the deserted deck,
      whose once white planking was now cracking and discolouring under the
      fierce rays of the torrid sun, to which it had been exposed for four
      months.
    </p>
    <p>
      We sat down together on a seat, which was placed for-ard of the skylight,
      and gazed at the lofty masts and spars, which, denuded of all their
      running gear, stood out stark, grim, and mournful against the rays of a
      declining sun. On the fore-topgallant yard a frigate bird and his mate
      stood, oblivious of our presence, and looking shoreward at the long, long
      line of verdure clothing the islets four miles away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simi,&rdquo; said Niâbon, clasping her little brown hands together at the back
      of her head, and leaning against the skylight, &ldquo;we must return to the
      canoe ere the tide riseth, for, see, the sun is low down, and Lucia will
      think that some harm hath befallen us if we delay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke in Samoan, the language she generally used when we were alone,
      for she could express herself better in it even than in English, so she
      said, though both Lucia and myself had often told her, not banteringly,
      that her English was sweet to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heed not the sinking sun, Niâbon,&rdquo; I replied, in the same language, &ldquo;the
      tide will not yet cover the reef for an hour or more, and the night will
      be bright and clear.... Niâbon, turn thy face to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took her hand and drew her closer to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Niâbon, I love thee. I have loved thee since the time when thou first
      saidst to me, 'Shall I give thee sleep?' And for ever since hast thou been
      in my mind. See, I have loved no other woman as I love thee, and it is my
      heart's desire to make thee my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew herself away from me with blazing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy wife, thy wife! Simi, what madness is this? Hast thou no eyes to see?
      Is thy mind so dull that thou dost not know that Lucia hath loved thee,
      and that even at this moment her heart acheth for thy return. Dost thou
      not <i>know?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I care not for her but as a friend,&rdquo; I said hotly; &ldquo;'tis thee alone I
      desire. Thou art always in my mind, and I will be good and true to thee,
      Niâbon; for I love thee well. Be my wife. Together thee and I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The angry light in her eyes died out, and she placed her cheek to mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simi, I care more for thee than for any one in the world, save Lucia, and
      Lucia hath all my heart and all my love. And she so loves thee, Simi&mdash;she
      so loves thee that it is her heart's desire to be thy wife.... Come, dear
      friend, let us return and forget all but that Lucia awaits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She passed her hand softly over my face, pressed her lips to my forehead,
      and then I followed her down from the silent deck on to the reef, and
      thence onwards to the canoe.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      All that she said to me that night as we returned over the stilly waters
      of the lagoon to our companions, I cannot now remember; I only know that
      as she sat facing me, and I paddled slowly and dreamily along, I promised
      her, dully and mechanically, to tell Lucia that night that I loved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she and thee will be happy, very happy, Simi. Her heart went out to
      thee from the very first. And children will come to thee, and I shall see
      them grow&mdash;the boys strong and brave as thou art, and the girls fair
      and sweet as Lucia&mdash;and yet shalt thou have thy heart's desire, and
      be spoken of as a man who did a great deed... a great voyage... and all
      that hath been done by the three men of whom thou hast so often thought
      will be but as little compared with this voyage of thine. And she so loves
      thee, Simi; ah, she so loves thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The soft murmur of her voice enthralled, took such possession of me
      mentally and physically, that I know not what I answered except that I
      said again and again, &ldquo;Ay, I love her, I love her, and I shall tell her of
      my love, and that she, and she alone, is my heart's desire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How long we were in getting back to the island I cannot tell, but I do
      remember that it was quite dark, and both Niâbon and myself were paddling
      vigorously when we heard Tepi's load hail of welcome, and a canoe shot up
      on the beach, and Lucia came towards me with outstretched hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim, oh Jim! I thought you were never coming back,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I folded her in my arms and kissed her. &ldquo;Lucia, dear, dear Lucia! Will you
      be my wife? For I love you,&rdquo; and then, scarcely knowing what I was doing,
      I strained her almost savagely to my bosom, and kissed her upturned face
      again and again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim, dear, dear Jim,&rdquo; and her soft arms were around my neck, &ldquo;and I love
      you too! I have loved you almost from the day you first came to Taritai,
      and Niâbon has told me that one day you would tell me that you loved me...
      that some day you would speak... Jim dearest, bend down; you are so tall,
      and I am so little; ah, Jim, I am so little, but my heart, dear, is so big
      with love for you, that I feel that I could take <i>you</i> in my arms,
      and kiss you as you now kiss me. Jim, dear, I never, never knew what love
      meant till now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A bright burst of flame illumined the beach, and Niâbon with a torch in
      her hand was standing at the water's edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The night is fair and good, and the wind is from the east. Let us away,
      dear friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice seemed to reach me as if from far, far away, though her dark
      face with the deep luminous eyes were so near, and, as she spoke, the
      boat, with Tepi and Tematau standing erect and waiting, grounded gently on
      the strand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, we shall sail to-night,&rdquo; I cried exultantly, as I again pressed
      Lucia to my heart, and showered passionate kisses upon her lips, &ldquo;we shall
      sail, Lucia my dearest; on, and on, and on, to the north-west, my beloved,
      till we come to our journey's end, and you and I shall never part again,
      no never, never, my dearest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, never, never shall ye two part again,&rdquo; cried Niâbon, casting down her
      torch; &ldquo;man with the strong and daring hand, and woman with the fond and
      tender heart. Thy lives are forever linked together. Quick, give me thy
      hand, Lucia, my dove, my own, my own!&rdquo; She sprang towards us, and took
      Lucia's hand in hers, and almost tore off her wedding ring, and then flung
      it far out into the lagoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sink, sink, thou ring of misery&mdash;thou golden circle which should
      have meant love and trust and happiness, but brought naught but hate and
      treachery and poison to her who wore it. Sink, accursed thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jim, Jim!&rdquo; and Lucia turned her streaming eyes to mine, &ldquo;it was my
      wedding ring, and when <i>he</i> gave it to me, I think he loved me,
      wicked and cruel as he was afterwards. Oh, Niâbon, Niâbon!&rdquo; In a moment
      Niâbon's arms were around her. &ldquo;My sweet, my sweet! thou art to me more
      than life,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;I love thee so, Lucia. I love thee so that I
      would die for thee! Heed not the ring, for now thou hast beside thee a
      good man&mdash;true, brave, and strong&mdash;one whose love will forever
      shield thee. Come, my dearest, come with me to the boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went down the beach together, with arms around each other's waists,
      and their footsteps guided by the still-burning torch lying on the sand. I
      followed, and in another minute I had the tiller in my hand, and told Tepi
      to push off, as Tematau ran up the jib.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How now for the passage?&rdquo; I cried, as I slipped my arm around Lucia's
      waist, and her lips met mine, &ldquo;how now for the passage, Tepi? Canst see?
      Canst see, Tematau?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Niâbon placed her hand on mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have no fear, Simi. The wind is fair and the passage through the reef is
      wide, and the ship on the right hand is a good guide. See, her masts stand
      out clear against the sky. And give me the tiller, for thou and Lucia are
      tired. So sleep&mdash;sleep till the dawn, and Tematau and Tepi and I
      shall keep watch through the night. How shall I steer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;North-west, north-west,&rdquo; I muttered, as Lucia laid her cheek to mine,
      &ldquo;north-west, but call me if the wind hauls to the northward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bent oyer Lucia and touched her face softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sleep, dear one, sleep till dawn,&rdquo; she said in a whisper, and then with a
      smile she turned to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simi, thou too art tired, and must sleep even as Lucia sleepeth now. See,
      her eyes are closed. How sweet and fair she is as she sleepeth! Ah, how
      sweet! So, let me touch thy face.&rdquo; She pressed her soft hand on my brow,
      and then, with Lucia's head pillowed on my breast, I slept.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      For seventeen days we made good progress to the north-west, though we met
      with such very heavy weather when between Minto Breakers Beef, and the
      island of Oraluk, that I had to run back to the latter place for shelter,
      and all but missed it. Although so small, it is very fertile, and the
      natives were very hospitable, Niâbon and Lucia being given a room in the
      chief's house, and I and my two men were given a house to ourselves, where
      we were very comfortable during our stay of four days, though unable to
      get about on account of the pouring rain, which hardly ceased for an hour.
      The chief's house was quite near to that in which we were quartered, so I
      spent a good deal of my time there, for although I cannot say that I was
      really in love with my future wife, her gentle endearments, and the
      happiness that shone in her dark eyes when I was with her gave me a
      certain restfulness, and I was well content.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had long since decided as to our future. After our marriage she was to
      stay with her sister, or with my friends, the Otano's, on Guam, whilst I
      made my way to my friend at Amboyna, and got him to provide me with such
      an amount of trade goods that when I returned to Guam I should be in a
      position to at once begin trading operations either in the Marianas, with
      Guam for my headquarters, or else choose some suitable place in the
      Caroline Archipelago. The boat, I had no doubt, I could sell at San Luis
      d'Apra, or San Ignacio, and this I intended to do if a fair price was
      offered me. Then I would take passage in one of the Spanish trading
      schooners to Manila, and from there I could easily get to Amboyna; and all
      going well, it was more than likely that my friend would lend or sell me
      on easy terms, one of his own small trading vessels, for he had half a
      dozen or more employed throughout the Moluccas, and on the coast of the
      Phillipine Islands.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the second day after our arrival on Oraluk, the rain cleared off for an
      hour, and I went over to the chief's house, and found Lucia conversing in
      Spanish with some native women who could speak it brokenly, for years
      before there had been a Jesuit mission on the island, but it had been
      abandoned, and the two priests, after a stay of five years, had gone back
      to Manila. Niâbon was not in the house&mdash;she had gone into the forest
      with some of the young girls, Lucia said, as she bade me come in and sit
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a strange girl, Lucia. She seems to love to be in the forest, or
      walking on the cliffs or mountain tops. I wish I knew the true story of
      her life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucia shook her head. &ldquo;She will not tell it, Jim, and I am sure she does
      not like to be questioned even by me. But yet she <i>has</i> told me a
      little, and there can be no harm in my telling you&mdash;I am sure she
      would not mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, why should she mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She told me that her very first memories of her childhood go back to when
      she was a child of six at Manhiki. She lived alone with her mother in a
      little hut quite apart from the other people. Even then she says she knew
      that her mother was a 'witch-woman' and was greatly feared by the natives,
      who yet came to her for charms and medicines. Who her mother was she does
      not know&mdash;but she is quite certain that she was a full-blooded
      Polynesian, though not a native of Manhiki. Her father she had never seen,
      nor had her mother ever made even the faintest allusion to him, and Niâbon
      herself had never dared question her on the subject. She told me, however,
      that she imagined he was a white man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am almost sure he was,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;she certainly is not a full-blooded
      native.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure of it too. But she does not like to be thought anything but a
      pure native. Why, I cannot tell, and have never asked her her reasons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is her mother still living?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know and do not like to ask her. She told me that she, her
      mother, and Tematau had left Manhiki and wandered through the islands of
      the South Pacific for many years. Tematau she says is a blood relation. He
      only took service as head boatman with Krause so as to be near her, for
      from the very first day she saw me, she determined to live at Taritai. And
      we have always been the closest friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know she loves you very dearly,&rdquo; I said, as I rose to return to my
      house, for just then we saw Niâbon herself coming through the village
      accompanied by a number of young women.
    </p>
    <p>
      We left Oraluk with a slashing breeze, which we held for eight days, the
      boat doing splendid work, and on the morning of the tenth day we sighted
      Guam, forty miles away, and looming blue against the sky line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three thousand miles,&rdquo; I cried exultingly, &ldquo;three thousand miles, Lucia&mdash;in
      fact, nearer three thousand two hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her dark eyes filled with tears as she pressed my hand and looked at the
      home of her childhood, and even Niâbon showed some trace of excitement as
      she bent her glance upon the great mound of land.
    </p>
    <p>
      I opened our one remaining bottle of wine which had been reserved for this
      auspicious day, and we shared it between us, whilst Tepi and Tematau were
      each given a stiff glass of grog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blow, good breeze, blow,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;blow steady and strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blow, good wind, blow steady and true,&rdquo; echoed my two men, as I eased off
      the main sheet, and the boat went faster through the water, and made a
      seething wake.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we were so well to windward of the island, I determined to head for
      Cape Ritidian, its north-west point, as from there I could easily pick up
      Port Taro-fofo, where, so Lucia assured me, we should find a pilot to take
      us down the coast to Port San Luis. Not having a chart of the island made
      it necessary for me to be cautious, but Lucia was quite sure that from
      Cape Ritidian we should have no trouble in running down the coast to
      Tarafofo&mdash;a port with which she was quite familiar, for she had been
      there on many occasions with her father. The anchorage was good, and there
      was a small town at the head of the harbour, where supplies could be
      obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do us nicely, then,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;we may as well spell there for a
      few days and get well rested. Oh, won't it be glorious to feel solid earth
      under foot once more after the last ten weary days!&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh Jim, the very
      thought of stepping on shore again makes my veins thrill. Oh, the great
      lovely green mountain forest, and the calls of the birds and the sweet
      sound of falling water&mdash;it is heaven to think of being there, in such
      a beautiful country after so many, many days upon the sea! Ah, you will
      love Guam, Jim! You cannot help it&mdash;it is the fairest, sweetest land
      in all the world, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her enthusiasm infected me to some degree, and bending forward to her, I
      whispered,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there a church at Tarafofo, Lucia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A vivid blush dyed her sweet face from neck to brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, so softly that I could scarce hear her, &ldquo;there has
      always been a church there for a hundred years. It was once plundered and
      burned by pirates, so one of the priests told me when I was a child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The breeze held good with us, and at four in the afternoon we ran in under
      Cape Ritidian and brought to half a cable away from the shore, which
      presented an aspect of the loveliest verdured hills and valleys
      imaginable, fringed with a curving snow-white beach, along which were
      scattered a few native houses, surrounded by plantations of bananas and
      papaw trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently a boat came off manned by natives dressed in very bright
      colours. They all spoke Spanish and at once offered to pilot us down to
      Tarafofo Harbour, which, they said, we could enter at any time, day or
      night; we accepted their services, and they came aboard, veered their boat
      astern, and by nightfall we came to an anchor in a small, but safe and
      exceedingly beautiful harbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here more of the country people came on board, late as it was, and pressed
      us to sleep on shore, telling us that there were some very comfortable
      houses in the village, which was situated two miles up the Tarafofo river.
      Then one of the visitors recognised Lucia, and now invitations poured in
      upon us from all sides, and finally Lucia and Niâbon, accompanied by
      Tematau, went ashore with them, leaving Tepi and myself on board.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Jim dear,&rdquo; said Lucia, as she was about to get into the shore
      boat, &ldquo;you will come on shore early, won't you? I don't like your staying
      behind, but you and Tepi will perhaps get a good night's rest now that
      three of us will be out of the way. I should never go to sleep if I stayed
      on board to-night. I am so excited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stooped and kissed her little upturned face, and in another moment she
      was in the boat, which at once pushed off into the darkness and made for
      shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, again,&rdquo; both she and Niâbon cried, and Tematau also called
      out <i>Tiâkâpo</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, good-night,&rdquo; I shouted, swaying our boat lantern in farewell.
      &ldquo;<i>Tiâkâpo, Tematau</i>. May you all sleep well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They made some merry laughing response, in which they were joined by their
      hosts, and then Tepi and I were alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      We put on the cabin hatches, spread out our sleeping mats and made
      ourselves comfortable for the night, and after half an hour's smoke, we
      fell asleep too tired to talk.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      À little after midnight the cool breeze suddenly died away, and both Tepi
      and myself awoke almost at the same moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The air hath grown hot, and is hard to breathe, master,&rdquo; said the big man
      &ldquo;I fear a storm is near.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It had indeed become very hot and stifling, but on looking at the
      barometer, I saw there was no change, and so felt no concern, for we were
      in an excellent position, no matter how hard, and from where it might
      blow. In half an hour or so, a few heavy splashes of rain fell, then a
      sudden shower, which necessitated us lifting off the hatch and going into
      the cabin, and it was then that Tepi complained to me of a severe
      headache, from which I was also beginning to suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had just struck a match to take another look at the glass, when suddenly
      the boat began to tremble violently, and then gave such a sudden jerk at
      her cable that I fell forward on my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mafuie! Mafuie!</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;Earthquake! earthquake!&rdquo;) cried Tepi in
      terror-stricken tones, as he clutched the coamings and looked seaward.
      &ldquo;Oh, Simi, look, look! The sea, the sea! We perish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      May God spare me from ever seeing such another sight! A black towering
      wall of water was rushing towards the boat, and ere I could frame my lips
      to utter an appeal for mercy to the Almighty it was upon us, and lifting
      us up on the summit of its awful crest, hurled us shoreward to
      destruction. Then I remembered no more.

    <hr />
    <p>
      Two weeks later I awoke to life and misery in a wide, low-ceiled room.
      Tepi, with his arm in a sling, was bending over me, and sitting beside my
      bed were two padres.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where am I, good fathers?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In San Ignacio, my son,&rdquo; replied the elder of the two. &ldquo;God has spared
      you and this Indian sailor of yours to render thanks to Him and the Holy
      Virgin for His mercy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where are my friends&mdash;the two girls and Tematau? Tell me, Tepi!
      Tell me,&rdquo; I said, with a dull terror at my heart. &ldquo;Why do you shake and
      hide your face?&rdquo; Then I turned to the priests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God's sake, tell me, gentlemen,&rdquo; and I clutched the hand of the one
      nearest to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Paradise, my son. They and three hundred other poor souls rendered up
      their lives to God thirteen days ago. Scarcely a score of people in
      Tarafofo escaped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The shock was too much for me, and I fell back again.

      As soon as I was strong enough for the journey I visited the scene, and
      was shown, on the spot where once the church had stood, a bare, grim
      mound. Underneath it lay all that was mortal of Lucia, Niàbon, Tematau,
      and three hundred others, who had in one swift moment been sent to
      eternity that dreadful night. Some of the few survivors, who, under the
      direction of a priest, and the Governor of San Ignacio, were erecting a
      tall wooden cross at the foot of the great grave, led me to the site of
      the house in which my dear companions had met their deaths. Nine other
      people were in the house when it fell and buried the sleepers, and the
      agony must have been short for them all.

      The tidal wave which accompanied the earthquake had hurled the boat and
      Tepi and myself for many hundreds of yards inland. I was picked up in the
      boat herself, stunned and severely injured. Tepi was carried into a rice
      field, and although his arm was broken, he at once set out in search of
      me, and the faithful fellow had come with me when I was carried in a
      bullock cart to San Ignacio, where the doctor and priests had brought me
      round after two weeks' dangerous illness.

      Before leaving Guam I spent two months with my friend José Otano, who
      tried hard to make me stay with him. At his house poor Lucia's
      heart-broken sister came to see me very often, and I bade her farewell
      with genuine sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then one day Tepi and I turned our faces once more to the islands of the
      south&mdash;and so the story of my strange adventure is told.
